which feature is made often explicit by frequently showing Prospero himself
articulating and writing the text of another role (for example, Gonzalo&#8217;s
utopia starting at II/1/149) and by having other actors/actresses play their
roles without moving their mouths (most apparent in the
Miranda&#8211;Ferdinand&#8211;Prospero trio at the end of Act I). This feature
can be regarded as a certain kind of <i><span style='font-style:italic'>cut</span></i>
or loss of information based on the argumentation of Patrice Pavis.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Pavis argues
that in the act of reading a play, the context, intonation and the
pseudo-physicality of the speakers must be created internally by the reader
him- or herself, while in an actual (theatrical or filmic) performance this
task is done partly by the conscious choices of the director and actor and
partly by the inevitable physical reality and qualities of the actor on stage.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[4]</span></font></span><![endif]></span></span></a>
In other words, Pavis follows the tradition of regarding the performance as a
realization of one of the potentials of the given text, filling in the <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>gaps</span></i> in it in a sense.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Despite John
Gielgud&#8217;s (and possibly Greenaway&#8217;s joint) efforts to develop a
consistent and distinct intonation for all characters, it can be suggested that
this one-voice method segregates the verbal level from the physical presence of
the actors / actresses; that is to say, the speech loses its context that Pavis
argues to materialize the text. Therefore, in Greenaway&#8217;s adaptation, the
verbal layer retains the qualities associated with a written text: it can be
treated as an overextended monologue of a single personage (or agent in our
case); it is more associative and more ritual than ordinary speeches of actors
/ actresses would be. <i><span style='font-style:italic'><o:p></o:p></span></i></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>This is the
very technique which most probably suggested the careful deletion of all
interpersonal verbal signals retaining the flow of communication. This is most
apparent at the beginning of Act I, Scene 2, where Miranda is actually asleep
while Prospero relates their story to her. The outbursts of the constant fear
of Prospero that Miranda is not paying attention: &#8220;Dost thou attend
me?&#8221; (I/2/78) <span class=GramE>&#8220;Thou attend&#8217;st not!&#8221;</span>
(I/2/87) &#8220;Dost thou hear?&#8221; (I/2/106) are all deleted as are
Miranda&#8217;s reassuring answers. (One might question the dramaturgic
necessity of this tool in the original Shakespearean script as from
Miranda&#8217;s answers it is apparent that she is paying attention, what is
more, often engages in the storytelling by asking questions or contributing to
it with her own memories.) The wit-combat, which is probably impossible to
render in one voice, is also deleted from the beginning of Act II, Scene 1 for
(probably) similar reasons.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Having seen
the technique, its aim (or &#8216;meaning&#8217;) is still to be shed light
upon. Many features in the film suggest that Prospero is portrayed as the agent
and causer of all happenings and actions. It is he who conjures up and controls
the ship by words and writing; it is he who controls all characters by speaking
&#8216;through&#8217; them. Also note the use of circles by the Ariels for <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>conjuring up the travelers:</span></i> first, Ariel
draws a circle with spokes when relating the details of the storm (0:34:00),<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

and all three Ariels draw a large circle with the help of a pendulum-like pair
of compasses on a large sheet just before all the characters are led in at the
end of the last scene (V/1/58; 1:38:00). (Cf. Mak&#8217;s drawing a circle to
make the other three shepherds sleep in <i><span style='font-style:italic'>The
Second Shepherds&#8217; Play:</span></i> &#8220;But about you a circill, / As
round as a moon, / To I have done that I will, / Till that it be noon, / That

which action is also connected to sorcery and control.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All this evidence seems to suggest that
Prospero is, in fact, the creator of not only the story, the plot and the
actions but of the characters, too.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The one-voice
technique can be argued to support and, possibly, to represent this role of
Prospero, that is, it shows that all other characters in the play are actually
Prospero himself. This argumentation seems to point to the direction that these
characters are totally dependent on Prospero. However, it is interesting to see
their independence restored precisely after Prospero&#8217;s performative
speech action: &#8220;I&#8217;ll break my staff, / Bury it certain fathoms in
the earth, / And deeper than did ever plummet sound / I&#8217;ll drown my
book[s]&#8221; (V/1/55&#8211;58), as after this point, the actors/actresses use
their own voices and the long-missing movement of mouths also appears.
Naturally, Prospero&#8217;s changing back into the Duke of Milan is not
compatible with his being a magician, so the spell that has enabled him to
control the characters from the very beginning (note that the exclamation
&#8220;Bos&#8217;n!&#8221; (I/1/1) is uttered by him already) ceases to be.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>It is at this
point that it might be worth pointing out that the idea of using the voice of
Prospero only, which, as can be seen, was very probably an intentional and
highly conscious decision on the side of the makers of the film, is not carried
through consistently, as the parts of Miranda are always spoken by Gielgud and
a female voice in unison. Accepting the above outlined suggestion about the
role of the one-voice technique, this piece of fact is hard to integrate into
the present interpretation. The most probable explanation for the voices of
Miranda is that this way the fact that Prospero is speaking <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>as</span></i> Miranda is more easily understandable
by the audience as Miranda&#8217;s would be the only case when Prospero&#8217;s
speech would have had to cross genders.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Another
exception to the one-voice technique is when the Ariels speak with their own
voices and even write into the script: they scribble the sentence &#8220;Your
charm so strongly works &#8216;em / That if you beheld them, your affections /
Would become more tender&#8221; (1:35:30) onto the paper. This moment of the
Ariels regaining their independence could be explained by the dramaturgical
decision that they are to soften the mood of Prospero. Otherwise, even the
singing of the youngest Ariel is accompanied by Prospero&#8217;s uttering the
sentences either in advance or immediately after they have been sung. So,
overall, the one-voice analysis seems to hold for the adaptation.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>In connection
to the verbal layer of the film so far investigated, one might also try to
focus on the auditory component of the artwork in general. Although this
observation is not something that is &#8216;missing&#8217;, still, let me call
attention to the fact that the characters (both the &#8216;real&#8217; ones and
the spirits) seem to be divided into two categories: earthly and ethereal.
While earthly characters (all those &#8216;of flesh and blood&#8217; and
Caliban) speak in prose, ethereal ones are either silent (the many unnamed
spirits) or they are singing (the three Ariels and the characters in the second
masque, Iris, Ceres and Juno). No visual distinction can be made between these
two groups of characters: nakedness, for example, while a constant quality of
the spirits, is not true for Iris, Ceres and Juno; and also appears in the
other <span class=GramE>group,</span> for example, Ferdinand lies naked on the stairs
exhausted at the beginning of Act IV, Scene 1. Also, the wide collar dominating
the costumes of the shipwrecked noblemen also appears on the three goddesses.
Thus, it can be suggested that the difference between inherently mortal
characters and immortal ones appears on the auditory level only; and this fact
shows that despite the many visual symbols and effects the movie makes use of,
it also focuses on the clear and careful usage of sound and speech.</span></font></p>

investigated elements in the play which can be considered to be missing from
the film, now let me turn to elements which seem to be added.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Apparently,
the notion of the many books of Prospero is totally new in the film as, naturally,
the Shakespearean script recording the verbal layer of a past performance lacks
the verbal explanations of the books introduced. When investigating elements
added to a preexisting script in a performance, it seems to be useful to
concentrate on the kinds of thoughts or &#8216;meanings&#8217; they convey to
the overall structure (i.e., the aim of their introduction) and the way they
are connected to the already given material.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Let me
consider the second part of the question first and focus on the points in the
text and the film where the books are being introduced. It has been suggested
above that the speech, stripped of its immediate context, is more apt to
trigger various associations and it seems that this quality of the text becomes
especially important here. This is because the insertion of the introduction of
various books can be argued to be local phenomena; that is, they are associated
with the speech that precedes them. The &#8216;Book of Water&#8217;, for
example, is introduced right at the beginning, when Prospero, sitting in the
pool, calls for the boatswain. The &#8216;An Alphabetic Inventory of the
Dead&#8217; is presented when Prospero relates the victims of the usurping of
his dukedom by his brother (0:19:50); the &#8216;Book of Earth&#8217; is
introduced alongside with Caliban, who also &#8220;tortures&#8221; other books
(here probably representing general culture) by urinating and defecating on
them (0:39:00); the &#8216;Book of Love&#8217; is presented with the arrival of
Ferdinand (0:46:30); the &#8216;Book of Utopias&#8217; clearly refer to
Gonzalo&#8217;s ideas cited above; the &#8216;Book of Motion&#8217; is shown
when Ariel promises to perform the task assigned to him quickly (1:19:20).
These pieces of evidence appear to suggest that although books and papers
clearly function as visual symbols at certain points in the film, the catalogue
of them contributes little to the plot as the books are adapted to the textual
environment, not the local text to the books.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The only point
in the artwork where the presence of books dominates the plot is the general
idea of portraying Prospero as controlling and creating the characters while <i><span

Otherwise, the thematic books merely elaborate the material or conceptual
associations triggered by the Shakespearean text.</span></font></p>

face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>If this is so,
the question might be raised whether the presence of various books contribute
to the overall structure at all or remain at the level of mere ornaments.
Although not to the Shakespearean plot, but they can be argued to contribute to
the world-view expressed by the film. This world-view is expressed by the fact
that the books are represented as containing every possible types of knowledge
(about the story) already (before the story unfolds itself); and articulated
clearly by Prospero when he introduces the &#8216;Book of Universal Cosmography&#8217;
as early as at I/2/184, and describes &#8220;a structure of Universe where all
things have their [logical] place and [&#8230;] obligation to be
fruitful&#8221; (0:28:20). In other words, the world-view of <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>Prospero&#8217;s Books</span></i> mimes that of the
Renaissance, which, with the expansion of natural sciences, held that the world
is knowable, recordable and well structured. Prospero, by having his books,
literally owns the world and is capable of understanding and controlling it.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>This latter
idea seems to be expressed by the symbol of paper, too. When Prospero is
already writing the words in the book &#8220;We split, we split!&#8221; and is,
undoubtedly, in control (0:</span></font><st1:time Minute="20" Hour="19"><span
 lang=EN-US>19:20</span></st1:time><span lang=EN-US>), then sheets of paper can
be seen falling down and covering the floor. The reverse scene, when the sheets
are flying upwards gradually uncovering the ground can be found at the point
when Prospero lays down his mantle and declares: &#8220;<span class=GramE>Lie</span>
there, my art!&#8221; <span class=GramE>(I/2/25).</span> These two scenes show
that in the symbolism of the film, paper and thus, books are associated with,
or even represent the magical power of Prospero.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Sheets of
paper also appear in Act II, Scene 2, where, at first, Prospero is seen
uttering the words of Caliban. A cut then leads to the actual scene, where
sheets are falling from above. Seeing Prospero writing the monologue of Caliban
reassures that he controls the character, while the presence of paper in the
actual scene may, according to the above interpretation of the symbolism of
paper, represent the presence of Prospero&#8217;s power in his absence.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The books, at
times, are also presented as having the capability of taking the role of the
reality recorded in them: the book of Anatomy and the Anatomy of Birth,
according to Prospero, contain figures of the human body that move and feel,
even bleed (0:21:50). (To support this idea further, the film actually includes
a scene where a pregnant woman peels off her skin and abdominal wall to reveal
her internal organs and the placement of the baby.)</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>But if the
idea that reality recorded in the books is reality itself can be accepted, then
it immediately leads to a conclusion contradicting our previous assumption
about the role of Prospero as the creator of the characters. As the books exist
already when the film starts, and as, according to the above idea, the
knowledge coded in them is reality, then reality exists in its entirety right
from the beginning. The question arises whether Prospero creates the characters
actively or simply follows the knowledge pre-given to him by his books. </span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The question,
in other words, is about the idea or concept the books symbolize (the first
part of the question raised at the beginning of the section). They stand for
either knowledge (culture) only or, as argued above, knowledge and reality. In
the first case, Prospero is supposed to be an active participant in the
creation of the characters, as suggested by his <i><span style='font-style:
italic'>writing</span></i> in a <i><span style='font-style:italic'>book, </span></i>that
is, actively arranging, structuring and coding the reality he is creating based
on the knowledge found in his other books. In the other case, the universe is
already discovered fully (as it was deemed possible in the Renaissance) and
coded in the books of Prospero, which books not only represent the culture with
which Prospero is able to control the island, but stand for (are) reality
itself. In this case, Prospero cannot possibly <i><span style='font-style:italic'>create,
</span></i>as everything has been already created: he merely acts as a mediator
in controlling the actions of the characters. The question, in short, is
whether the creative and/or artistic power resides in Prospero or in his books.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The standpoint
the film takes in this question is far from clear. A plausible suggestion would
be to view books as the means for creation (as is the staff Prospero intends to
break), as whatever is written in the book in front of Prospero becomes
immediate reality&#8212;either on the screen or in the pool on a small scale.
But this suggestion, also underpinned by Prospero&#8217;s last action of
destroying all the books similarly to the staff, questions the role of the
&#8216;thematic&#8217; books presented in the course of the film. If various
facets of reality exist because these facets are contained in these books
(similarly to the case of the story and the characters: they exist because they
are written down), then the destruction of these books means the destruction of
reality. But a Prospero destroying all reality before returning to the future
non-existing </span></font><st1:City><st1:place><span lang=EN-US>Milan</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US> would be hard to reconcile with the almost happy ending the play
and the film provide. The suggestion of regarding all books occurring in the
film as tools for creation therefore should be dropped. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>It seems,
then, that some books <i><span style='font-style:italic'>record </span></i>nature
and reality (the thematic ones) while other <i><span style='font-style:italic'>control
and create </span></i>them (the one Prospero is writing into). This would mean
that the thematic volumes represent culture which Prospero&#8217;s power is
based on&#8212;but then again the problem arises why Prospero is inclined to
destroy culture by destroying all his books in the end.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>It is most
probably not by chance that while Prospero talks about being furnished with
&#8220;volume<u>s</u>&#8221; in the original Shakespearean text (I/2/167), he wants
to drown only one book in the end. Contrary to this, in the film, Prospero
declares, &#8220;I&#8217;ll drown my book<u>s</u>.&#8221; (</span></font><st1:time
Minute="38" Hour="1"><span lang=EN-US>1:38:30</span></st1:time><span
lang=EN-US>) <span class=GramE>This</span> plural makes it apparent that the
otherwise subtle symbolism of <i><span style='font-style:italic'>Prospero&#8217;s
Books</span></i> is far from being free from inconsistencies. While in
Shakespeare&#8217;s play, Prospero abjures only his magic, in the film, he
might appear to destroy and shun all knowledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Naturally, the
symbolism of the film was most probably not carried this far so that the
inconsistency could have been discovered. But still, it can be stated that the
books, representing reality or solely knowledge, appear to be universal by
covering all possible areas of reality. Indeed, the destruction of the books
also <span class=GramE>support</span> this idea as the books are destroyed by
two extremes that seem to span nature: by fire and water&#8212;simultaneously.</span></font></p>

Pretending that somebody else is speaking was done (to the extent of a short

The symbolism of books and paper would pose no problems for the stage, either.
It might be interesting, then, to investigate what <span class=GramE>kind of

subtle scenery and stage machinery were most probably present, but still, many
passages can be found in the text which describe or refer to events or things
residing off-stage. Examples can be (a) the small description of the
&#8216;carcass&#8217; (I/2/140&#8211;150) with the rats; (b) the lions and
beasts described by Sebastian (II/1/313); (c) the story of freeing Ariel (the
middle of Act I, Scene 2); (d) Stephano&#8217;s idea about marrying Miranda
(1:08:20) or (e) Alonso mourning over his son (III/3/4&#8211;10). In a somewhat
realistic staging of the play, the images conjured up by words in the above
mentioned sections are not easy to show for various reasons.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>First, the
objects most often are separated from the speaker not only in space, but also
in time (cases a, c, d) or they are simply not true (b, e). Thus, showing, for
example, the prince drowned while Alonso accepts the thought that he is dead on
a stage which is perceived realistically might lead to misinterpretations by
making the spectator think that the portrayed element is true or refers to the
present. Still, it is not the real problem that may prevent a more symbolic
production of the play from showing such images on stage.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The second,
more serious problem for the stage is that these passages are usually short. It
means that there is little time to reorganize parts of the stage, cue the light
on the particular element, etc. and do it in a way not to shift the focus from
the monologue unnecessarily. (This task can be easily solved by the use of
projectors, but then, of course, film and stage has begun to merge, and there
is little point in investigating &#8216;filmic&#8217; and &#8216;stage-like&#8217;
solutions.)</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The image of
rats, for example (a), is evoked only by one or two words. These few seconds
are enough for the film to show an image of rats and to disturb the spectator
who, being enchanted by the archaic text, most probably has not visualized actual
rats up to that point. Such an effect, while retaining the original text, would
be extremely hard to achieve on stage.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Similarly, in
case (d), when Stephano is shown having sex with Miranda, the image is shown
only for a few seconds&#8212;and using a similar image on stage would be even
more complicated as the actor-Stephano would have to be in two scenes at the
same time.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Thus, these
small scenes, reflecting short phrases and forcing the spectator to realize the
real / literal meaning of the text can be considered to make <i><span
style='font-style:italic'>Prospero&#8217;s Books </span></i>an artwork having a
filmic, not stage-like perspective.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>The small
screen, which is also used often either to put a scene in front of a backdrop
determining the mood or circumstances (like when the noblemen on the ship appear
in the small square while in the background, the rain continues to fall), or to
show an object separated either temporally or spatially from the actual scene
(for example, a male body, presumably Ferdinand&#8217;s, appear swimming when
Alonso is being consoled that his son might have well survived the storm),
creating a special kind of visual montage, would be again hard to realize on
stage. </span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>One further
element, which <i><span style='font-style:italic'>Prospero&#8217;s Books </span></i>most
probably drew solely from filmic traditions, is the long pans following
Prospero going to (to the left) and coming back (from the left) from
Miranda&#8217;s bedroom in Act I, Scene 2. The pans, showing the many spirits
performing strictly choreographed chores and visible only in the flashes,
successfully and dramatically introduce the &#8216;realm&#8217; or
&#8216;house&#8217; of Prospero quite similarly to the fixed or moving total
plans introducing a new environment in other films.</span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>This point
leads us to the last facet of <i><span style='font-style:italic'>Prospero&#8217;s

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.95pt;text-indent:14.2pt'><font size=3
face="Times New Roman"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt'>Quite contrary
to the stage directions, almost all scenes are played in a colonnade. The
stairs and the long walks of Prospero also seem to contradict the traditional
notion of a &#8216;cell&#8217; by which Prospero&#8217;s lodging is described
in the Shakespearean script. One of the interpretations of this difference
might be derived from the previous observation of relating the long pans to
catalogues of the spirits under Prospero&#8217;s command: that similarly to
books, the place in which Prospero lives should be interpreted symbolically. It
represents the culture and power Prospero owns and embodies, as he himself
declares: &#8220;my library / <span class=GramE>Was</span> dukedom large
enough&#8221; (I/2/109&#8211;110).</span></font></p>

course of this essay, I have considered elements that seem missing from <i><span

original Shakespearean script. Such elements (necessarily) turned out to be
inherently verbal, and their investigation led to the description of the
one-voice technique the film makes use of. I have touched upon the possible
reasons for some cuts and deletions, <span class=GramE>then</span> suggested
that the presentation of Prospero as the creator of the characters is actually
the aim of the usage of the one-voice technique. Some inconsistencies in the
usage of this technique were also revealed in the case of the roles of Miranda

turned to the investigation of elements that are undoubtedly new and considered

found.</span></font></p>
