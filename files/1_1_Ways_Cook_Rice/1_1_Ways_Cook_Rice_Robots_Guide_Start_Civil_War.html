<a name="b1c1"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book1.gif" class="img1"/></p><h1>Book 1<br/>Chapter 1</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">On the sunny side of a planet named Glaucon, in the front room of a terrace house
at 
 51°30'–0°3'
Cable Street, Anaktor,
 Adda Frier creaked her neck 
as she turned to see Elb Washer appearing unexpectedly
in the door that led to the entrance hall. The Friers were having a little party
to celebrate the anniversary of the construction of Adda’s grandfather, Pattero.
Half a dozen guests had already arrived, and
 the front door was left 
open as
 almost everyone was welcome, but 
Elb came
 without as much as an implicit invitation.</p>

<p class="pnorm">A second later everyone in the room was looking at him, falling silent in sinister
expectation. 
 His iron body was glistening in the harsh sunshine that poured down from the
pale green patch of sky visible through the entrance. He was equipped with a
plastic bag, which he clasped tightly, as if he was afraid that something might
escape from it.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He cast a furtive glance around.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Here’s… a little something,’ he stuttered with his mouth drawn into a half-smile,
and then, to the horror of the Friers and their guests, he emptied the contents
of his bag—a slimy, putrescent heap of highly infectious grade-B malicious
software—onto the phosphor-green pixelated carpet, and shouted, ‘Kiss my outlet!’ before
he ran out and disappeared.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Now, this kind of behaviour was less than unbecoming of a government employee,
and, more specifically, a tax regulator that Elb Washer worked as.
 Unacceptable though
it was, it wasn’t surprising, as it was part of a long feud between  the Washer and the Frier families.
This is the story of this feud, how it started and how it destroyed Glaucon;
and of a love that somehow escaped the end.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">The planet which had the misfortune of carrying the
 two families on
its back, together with all the other robots that inhabited their kingdom surrounding
Cable Street, also happened to be crippled by an axial tilt of almost 90 degrees.
It wasn’t born this way. Its difference was the result of a collision with a
rogue protoplanet when it was still in its teens, which was followed by a short,
but explosive relationship.</p>

<p class="pnorm">To cover its defect, the giant planet shrouded itself in green and blue clouds,
and led a life of seclusion, renting the seventh 
 orbit
  in the house of a stingy landlady who worked as an ageing yellow star. Patiently,
it suffered the contempt of the solar system’s other occupants, as well as the
effects of its handicap, which meant that for half of its orbital period, its
feet got all the light and heat from the star, and it had to wait for almost
a score Earth years until it could bask its head for a change.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The 
 robots
  squirming under its heavy atmosphere on the sunny hemisphere were gladly unaware
of the general disposition of their host. They enjoyed the constant sunshine,
and although there were stories circulating about travellers who’d seen a dark
world in perpetual night far, far away, they generally dismissed those accounts
as fidgets of a deranged imagination. 
 The robots themselves were all made of metal, and had quite consciously evolved
into electro-mechanical machines optimised for their environment as each generation
used the knowledge amassed by their predecessors to build better and better descendants.
They had heads, usually one, as well as arms and legs, two of each, with nuts
and bolts to attach them to their trunks; but because they were modular and jocular,
sometimes they chose not to wear them all.
  They were also curious by nature, and drilled deeper and deeper holes into their
planet to see what was inside, and they were lucky enough to have struck&nbsp;–,
well, not gold, but something black and oily that they named <i>oil.</i> Some
of the young robots with an entrepreneurial spirit suggested that this development
would make them very happy, and it was fun at the beginning indeed. But they
quickly grew tired of sliding up and down in the dark liquid like a bunch of
schoolchildren, so—as this oil turned out to be a much better lubricant than
the tiny marbles and graphite they used before—they set aside a small portion
for the elderly and rusty with creaky joints to reduce the noise pollution, and
they started to give away the rest of the oil to interplanetary merchants for
free.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was when
 King Sayn, their thin-armed and thin-legged monarch,  
figured that if those merchants liked this stuff that much, they could ask for something
in return, that the oil really began to make them happy. They asked for ore,
helium for the kids, multi-coloured crystals that they shot up into the sky,
and many other pretty things, and, unlike their planet, became quite content
with the way things were. It has to be noted that not much later, the King was
forced to sell the oil wells to the private sector to steer the country out of
a recession, and that most of the wells dried up soon after that anyway, but
this is not a case study of alien economics. This is the story of a basic, all-encompassing
question that was about to transform life on this planet altogether. And the
question was: how to cook the perfect rice.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Slowly and gradually, this issue grew in importance to the point that it threatened
to overpower and destroy Glaucon’s robots. For it is said that you lose all the
flavour of rice if you rinse it before cooking; instead, you should <i>sauté</i>
it in a dash of oil first. To be more exact, this is 
what
Pattero and the rest of the Frier family
 said. The Washers were of the opinion that you should do the exact opposite.
Rinse the rice thoroughly to get rid of the unhealthy and sticky extra starch,
or, even better, soak it for a couple of hours to save cooking time and fuel,
and avoid destroying the delicate grains with excess heat. Pattero Frier’s elder brother,
Kantro,
 had the audacity to ask why anyone should give a tinker’s about cooking
rice this way or that way, as it was only needed for an obscure ritual
performed each week during which robots were supposed to drop a grain
of prepared rice into their batteries, where it immediately disappeared
in a bubble of sulphuric acid.
No one was sure why this was important, or how the rice was supposed to 
be prepared, but they replied to Kantro
that it was about principles, and told him to shut up. (Now this wasn’t something
particularly hard, as Kantro had been dead for some time by then—save for his
left hand, which still worked with all the servos intact, and which Pattero had
decided not to take to the junk yard with the rest; instead, he’d placed it on
a shelf on a nice doily next to a porcelain vase. The only problem was that Kantro
kept falling off when he became agitated and started to gesticulate too vehemently.)</p>

<p class="pnorm">Elb’s visit was far from being the first incident between the Washers
and the Friers. Just a week before, it was 
 Pattero Frier
 who’d spent hours marching up and down Cable Street 
 running his fingers through the brittle coils of wires that decorated the top
of his head
  and shouting into a megaphone calling the Washer family names, successfully
ruining a party organised to celebrate the age of Elb’s mother, Mumha. And then,
before that, it was 
 Mumha Washer, a strong, stocky stay-at-home grandma,
 who’d sent an anonymous letter to Pattero’s son, Ricco, telling him that his
father was an S.O.B. and other really not nice things, probably the worst of
which was a ‘rice-burner.’ To avoid any confusion, she’d also signed the letter
using her real name, ‘so that,’ she said, ‘those clowns would know which way
the wind blows.’ And before that, 
 Ricco
  had dumped some garbage in front of Mumha’s house, with a note pinned to the
top of the heap saying ‘Rice drowns here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There might be some who’d say that such a difference in culinary conviction is
not profound enough to cause all this malice, enmity and anti-social behaviour.
Those observers are wrong. Emotions are always irrational, even if they are merely
simulated. Still, to show that there might’ve been something else going on in
the background, let me let you in on a secret not many knew. What was common
knowledge was that 
Mumha Washer,
 the widower, and the elderly 
Pattero Frier,
 seeing that they were not going to become any younger, and that they were actually
getting closer and closer to the feared Blue Screen of Death, embarked on something
that could best be described as an amorous relationship. The couple enjoyed the
unanimous support of both families.
The Washers were not particularly rich, but had members high up at the Court of the King,
 while the older Frier brothers, Pattero and Kantro, were the shareholders
in the profitable cloud factory of the family. The factory
didn’t do much apart from turning blue clouds into green ones and <i>vice
versa,</i> but the robots habitually got bored with the look of their sky, so it
was a never-ending business generating a steady income.
Mumha’s and Pattero’s 
romance could’ve got the Friers more influence in politics, and the Washers
some capital to yield at least a bit of weight to what they wanted to say. But
what almost no one outside the families knew was that unfortunately, just before
the solemn ceremony of conjoining two citizens in love by exchanging their remote
access encryption keys, Mumha and Pattero fell out, and the marriage fell through.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">At the time not even family members knew exactly what had happened, but
 gradually it transpired that the straw that had broken the eye of the needle
was the way to cook rice.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What are you doing now?’ Pattero asked in a low voice on that fateful weekend
as
 Mumha, wearing brown paint and an apron that was large enough to cover her stout torso,
was standing in his kitchen, holding a colander under the tap.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What?’ Mumha snapped 
 with flashes in her tiny black eyes,
 and then, remembering that they were supposed to have made it up after another
row, quickly added, ‘I can’t hear you over the water, love.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I said: what are you doing?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why, washing the rice, of course. You said you wanted to do the rice now, and
you have to rinse it well before cooking, you know.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, honey, you don’t wash the rice.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No? What do you do with it, then?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You fry it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You do what?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Mumha,’ Pattero said after a short pause, ‘I don’t think it’s going to work.
It’s not you, it’s the way you are.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">And that was it. They parted on amicable terms after three hours of shouting,
crying, and hurling old cathode ray tube screens, mainly at each other. Both
accused the other of subjecting rice to unspeakably cruel and brutal treatment,
and became certain that their now insignificant other must be missing some transistors
upstairs. Then, Mumha left Pattero’s kitchen and house for good, and both of
them made sure that their families knew what they thought of the other.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They succeeded surprisingly well in this endeavour, and quickly convinced their
kindred that those who had the electrons of the other flowing in their veins,
and, in general, anyone who disagreed with their way of cooking the revered seeds—the
way that had allegedly been passed down from Version One through innumerable
generations—must be of unsound mind, someone who cannot be trusted, and might
actually be dangerous until converted to follow the right path. And so it began.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">‘Help me with this mess, and then, after that, maybe,’ Feina Frier replied to
her daughter when
 Adda, casting down her otherwise restless eyes,
 asked whether she could go outside to the rest of the kids.
The sun was warm; it was after school,
and under the thick green sky, where there wasn’t much traffic, the suburban streets were full of young robots
playing noisily.
But Adda was left to help her mother disinfect and update
the carpet in the front room
 after their guests had fled the house in terror seeing what Elb Washer had brought.
She hated updating, because it always stained her fingers, 
 ruined her off-white enamel on the arms and the knees, and,
 to make things worse, she knew this wasn’t the real reason why she had to stay.
It was because her mother must’ve suspected she wanted to meet Cynd Washer, the
son of their unwelcome visitor. And, as most of the time, her mother was right.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘This has really got to stop,’ grumbled Feina as she hunted down the last piece
of malicious software with a pair of tongs.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’ll make Elb regret this,’ hissed Ricco, 
 a lean, angular piece of metal standing in the kitchen door, with deep-set eyes
burning with anger.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Their father, Pattero, sat silently on a glass armchair, resting his left fist
on a cast-iron coffee table. Of the two Frier brothers, he
was the one sporting the title of MD
in their cloud factory, but in reality, that didn’t amount to much,
as everything had long
been completely automated because
of the constant bickering between his and Kantro’s side of the family.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Both he and his son had long, curly hair-like wires attached to their skulls
that they constantly fidgeted with. Many regarded this useless extension as an
arrogant display of vanity, but as it had been passed down through generations
of Friers, Pattero and Ricco never considered abandoning it, and wore it with
pride.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Time passed slowly; 
the front room of the Frier house
 had been cleaned up; the latest virus definitions had been downloaded, and 
Adda, as she lay down in her tiny bedroom and
 tried to listen to the voices coming through from the living room to see whether
they were still very angry, imagined what she and 
Cynd
 would be doing. She knew he had the wrong type of electrons, but still…
they’d run along the road to see who gets to the little patch of wild screensavers
first, and laugh all the way there 
with
 Cynd’s cubic head glinting in the white sunlight.
 Then, they’d just sit on a bench pushing each other’s buttons until… well,
until it would get late, and 
Feina
 would come to fetch her, looking at Cynd as if he was an ugly toaster. And she’d
feel like running back to tell him that no one meant to hurt him, but would only
dare to look back for a moment, and see 
Elb
 also coming from their house on Cable Street for his son, and she’d quickly
turn back and walk closer to her mum, and try to be as little as she could.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The voices grew louder, and 
Pattero
 said something about taking the matter to the Court and going straight to the King,
because enough, as they say, was enough. But Adda felt exhausted, and the sounds
got lost in a swirl of colours; and, for all she knew, she might’ve only heard
their planet cursing the old protoplanet, or praying for another one to come.</p>



<a name="b1c2"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book1.gif" class="img1"/></p><h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Mere hours after Elb’s unwelcome visit,
Pattero Frier, surrounded by his family, stood in front of the King in the presence chamber
of the Palace in Anaktor, the capital city of the kingdom.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And that,’ he grinned as he closed shut the briefcase he’d placed on the 
 sulphur-coloured velvet carpet,
 ‘concludes our presentation.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The King paused for a second, twiddling the bite-marked arm of his 
 spectacles.
His torso was disproportionally broad compared to his arms and legs, which he
could get fixed, had he the time and courage.
 He was seated uncomfortably on the throne made of satin-black slate. Behind him,
 there was an ashlar wall lavishly inlaid with emeralds, sapphires and topaz,
which were illuminated by the sunshine pouring through the square windows divided
into grids of glass cells.
  His enquiring eyes wandered from 
Pattero
 and 
Ricco
 to 
Feina and her daughter,
 and back.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Say, that bright stone on that silver ring,’ he said at last, leaning forward,
‘is that a real white dwarf from Andromeda?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ said 
Ricco.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And that black spall on that golden chain, is it really a piece of the Great
Void?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes indeed, Your Majesty.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Mr Godnor would be thrilled.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We hoped that he would find these trinkets to his liking, with his profound
knowledge of all the stars and the cosmos,’ replied
 Feina curling her firm lips into a smile,
 and bowed.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But,’ Sayn said, putting on his glasses again and raising his voice, ‘we mean
this is all very fine. However, the long years in this profession have taught
us that there’s only one thing that can make you not want something you’ve got,
and that’s to want something even more that you haven’t. So, our question to
you is, what do you want in return?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was not before
 King Sayn’s
 head 
started to show signs of wear where the crown was attached to it
  that he realised this basic truth, and it was remarkable in itself that he’d
reminded himself of it when facing his most dangerous enemy: things offered for
free. And although this can be in part attributed to his distrust of the Frier
family, what made it truly exceptional is a hardly negligible circumstance about
his household, namely, that it included the
 ‘other King,’ Mr Godnor.
 Now, Mr Godnor was not a clothes queer or a fitness fruit who’d throw a fit
to get hold of the latest achievements of the cosmetic and fashion industries,
and newer and newer spare parts to replace the scratched and wrinkled ones. But
he had an obsession with science in general and nature in particular,
 which he
pursued on a level that we could best describe as below amateur, but which seemed
quite advanced on his own planet. He was not ashamed to keep asking Sayn for
obscure (and usually very expensive) instruments and the rarest substances that
could only be found in galaxies on the other side of the Great Void, and to say
that it was all for the advancement of science, not his own benefit. And, sometimes,
the King couldn’t help but wonder if that handsome sum he’d spent on ‘basic research’
and the little holes that his significant other insisted on blowing with his
chemical experiments into the walls of the Royal Palace would really make their
world a happier place, or at least add a couple of points to his approval rating—something
which he watched with the anxiety of a politician standing for re-election. All
in all, Mr Godnor’s existence made the Friers’ lavish offer somewhat hard to
reject.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We,’ 
 Ricco Frier
  replied cautiously to Sayn’s question, ‘we thought it can never hurt to give
our King a present.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He looked at 
the King
  with his springy hair waving confidently,
 but 
Sayn remained silent.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘By which we mean,’ 
 Ricco’s father
  was quick to add, ‘that we’d be much indebted if Your Majesty accepted our gift
of unworthy knick-knacks, so that we could show our gratitude for having such
a wise and just monarch.’ If 
 Pattero
  had bowed any lower, he could’ve kissed the reverse side of the carpet.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We guess you mean that <i>we’d</i> be much indebted,’ replied the King in
a matter-of-fact tone. But before any of the guests could’ve replied, 
 Adda,
  recognising a familiar voice in the high-pitched chatter that filtered through
the square windows, whirled round and shrieked, ‘Cynd!’ as she ran out of the
room and down the stairs.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Although it was after school,
she didn’t even dare to hope that
Cynd
 might be at the Court,
   although he, as well as herself and a number of other
children, was always welcome at the Palace and in the surrounding gardens in
the far corner of Screen Park. (And Mrs Beetemle, the middle-aged wife of the
Chancellor, always had something nice made for them for tea.) Pattero frowned,
but remained silent because he didn’t want to direct the King’s attention to
the ongoing squabble; Ricco frowned, but remained silent because he couldn’t
really think of anything to say, and Feina frowned, but remained silent because
as a mother she couldn’t agree with Pattero more that Adda should keep coming
to the Court and benefit from being in favour with those in power.</p>

<p class="pnorm">What they didn’t realise, however, was that to remain silent had taken them a
little while, which even Sayn had noticed.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We cannot help but observe a certain… lack of affection in your behaviour
when it comes to the family of Mumha,’ he said. ‘Before this audience ends, we
ask you to tell us your reasons for that.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Throwing caution to the wind, the three Friers started gabbling like wound-up
tin birds on an artificial tree, telling the King that the Washers were primitive,
superstitious and abnormal creatures who believed in and did things that one
shouldn’t, and who were not worthy of the attention or trust of a well-behaved
citizen. By the time they’d finished, their eyes were flashing with anger.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Is there a particular reason,’ Sayn insisted, ‘why you dislike them so much?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">They were, at first, not entirely sure how to reply to such an obvious question.
Finally, it was Ricco who burst out, ‘Well, they wash rice for a start!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, we’ve heard about that nonsense. And is that all?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘As if it wasn’t enough!’ Feina said in indignation.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Indeed,’ replied the King, with a certain uncertainty in his voice. ‘Notwithstanding
this little incident, we do thank you for your consideration and for the extraordinary
gifts you have offered. Following the customary protocol, we will refer these
to our household, and you can expect a response in the coming months. Please
bear in mind that due to the volume of offers we receive, we might not be able
to reply before… well, before next week.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">And with that, the visitors bowed and backed out of the presence chamber, and
quickly left the castle without trying to find Adda so as not to make things
even worse.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">King Sayn liked listening to the twittering of children, tamed into some indistinct
chirping by the windows of the 
 throne room.
  He regarded them as innocent creatures yet untainted by negative parameters
like greed, hunger for power, or monosexuality. 
He usually let them play in the
 Clock-Rate Court,
even though the hand-knotted cloud elaborately ornamented with exotic motifs
that hovered over the court quickly got worn down by the zigzagging little heads,
and had to be replaced regularly at no little expense. This was all the more
important as this cloud was the one that obscured the adventurers’ way in the
neighbouring
  Mega Maze,
where a holographic projection of hedges, resident daemons and creeping currents
were installed to distract adventurers from reaching the last remaining part
of Version One in the centre, a precious item in the King’s collection of rarities
displayed on a richly decorated pedestal of zero gravity.
 Having dashed out of the
silvery double doors
into the court, it only took seconds for
Adda
to catch sight of
Cynd.
 Without a word, they ran into the Maze, and found their special spot in a dead-end,
 where a friendly daemon used to tell them stories of pirates from other galaxies,
and offer them holographic treasures made entirely out of light. Although the
daemon was nowhere to be seen, the generated hedges offered them some seclusion
from the other children, and they decided to stay there for a while.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I didn’t know you were coming here,’ Adda said as they plumped down onto the
concrete.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I just hoped you’d be here,’ Cynd replied, looking straight at his shiny toes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He was a fine piece of work, slender-built with a rectangular head and watery-blue
eyes, but, like most kids at his age, he was often moody, and then he slouched
around, keeping his eyes on the ground, seemingly not giving a damn about anything.
During these times he even neglected to brush and polish as he was supposed to
do because he, like his father, wore no paint or enamel.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I… I just wanted to say sorry for what my father did,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, this stupid rice-thing,’ Adda said, clenching her fists. ‘Maybe our parents
should just grow up. Everyone in the street thinks they’ve all gone nuts.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So you’re not mad at me?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It wasn’t your fault, was it?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, but I went to our place after my dad had come back, and you weren’t there.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I had to help mum clean up the mess.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m sorry,’ he said, and continued to stare at his lower extremities.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, quit sulking. And don’t make me beg. I’ve told you I’m not angry. Can’t
we talk about something else? I’m so fed up with this whole thing.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd raised his head, smiled, and said, ‘See, now you’re angry. I like it when
you’re angry.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh really?’ Adda’s cheeks heated up. ‘Then why didn’t <i>you</i> come and
pour that bag of stuff on our carpet? I’d’ve been real angry then.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd remained serious. ‘I would never ever do something like that. I wanted to
go round and help you and your mum, but I thought Ricco would throw me out. I’m
sorry.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He stretched out his arm in search for Adda’s hand, but her fingers moved to
hide themselves like a flock of frightened messengers. It was only then that
Cynd saw her nails.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What happened to your fingers?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That,’ she said, slowly raising her hand (as there was no point in trying to
conceal the obvious anymore) and 
 looking at her tapering white fingers with distinct yellowish stains
 as if she’d seen them for the very first time, ‘is because we’d run out of gloves,
and we had to update the carpet with our bare hands.
You should see mum’s elbow. It’s all yellow.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m so sorry,’ repeated Cynd wondering whether he should add that her fingers
looked all the more beautiful with that stubborn residue. Ultimately, he decided
that that would perhaps sound too old-fashioned and hollow, so he said, ‘I’ll
never let anything like that happen to you again, come what may,’ which, of course,
was much more original. But we tend to forget that it’s often been the zeal of
the young that has changed our world for the better, and that such sentiments
are never to be taken without due seriousness.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’ll figure out how,’ he went on, ‘but we’ll have to leave. I don’t want to
live in a place where we’re punished because of something we can’t help.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, that would be nice,’ she smiled, suddenly realising that they were already
holding hands. ‘Somewhere far away, in another galaxy, a little house with a
little kettle that would be so happy when we get home… Well,’ she sighed,
and wanted to add something about the importance of unattainable dreams in life
that her mother used to talk about when 
 a strong, brassy voice
 penetrated through the mirage hedges.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t tell me they fell for that nonsense,’ the voice said. The two lurkers
recognised it immediately: it belonged to Mikke Beetemle, the Chancellor. ‘I
can’t believe they’ve sunk that low. I got intel from one of our plants that
they were planning to stir up the neighbours, but I would never have imagined…
Those Friers would stop at nothing.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What?’ Adda whispered, with a mixture of surprise, fear and resentment. ‘Those
Friers? And a plant?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Shh!’ Cynd hissed, and the voice continued.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Who knows what they want with this delusional obsession with frying? As if nobody
could make a decent bowl of rice anymore. Frying, frying, frying everything!
A bunch of nitwit pyromaniacs. I think it’s high time we got together to figure out how to stop them.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Somebody else replied, but the imaginary hedge muffled the high-pitched sound.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, I agree, we can do that,’ Mikke replied, ‘and, actually, I think we should.
I’ll talk to Mumha and Elb, and I’ll try to find Cynd before it’s too late.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda waited for the voices to die away. ‘And I thought we were free from that
stupid thing here. And what did Pattero do to the neighbours?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">She looked at Cynd. A large, dark blue cloud crept in front of the sun, and cast
a wintry hue over the maze. ‘I so wish it would be over.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m afraid it’s only the start.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’ll have to be strong,’ she said, but it sounded like more a warning than
an encouragement. </p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We are strong.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">They got up to leave, and as they whisked off some creeping currents that had
climbed up their legs, Cynd, trying hard to keep his voice from faltering, asked,
‘Why do you think he wants to find me?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">They didn’t know. But, as it turned out, it was already too late.</p>



<a name="b1c3"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book1.gif" class="img1"/></p><h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Soon it became clear what the 
 Friers
  had done with their neighbours. They started to involve them in what hitherto had only been
a dispute between two families. They did it by
 reviving an old custom that had been forgotten
since Version Three came out of beta testing: they started to talk to them. The
neighbours were a bit surprised: they used to think the Friers were good-for-nothing
dimwits because they made their living out of clouds and thin air. And the more
the Friers talked, the more the neighbours felt better informed, enlightened,
and extremely grateful for the wise guidance they received. They now knew, for
example, that clouds were made of little particles, that were, although invisible
to the naked eye, tiny clouds themselves (for what else could a cloud be made
of?), which, in turn, were made of even tinier clouds, and so on, <i>ad
infinitum</i> (which sounded very nice). They’d also learnt that earthquakes were
not caused by tectonic movements, as they had previously thought, but by the
sighs of their discontent planet brooding over the sad fate of the Universe and
the inflated real estate market. (Incidentally, they happened to be right on
that one.) Oh, and they also mentioned that the way to cook rice was to fry it,
and, while there were some who thought otherwise, they clearly didn’t know what
they were talking about.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But the Washers didn’t sit on their laurels, either. They set out to advocate
the beneficial effects of water and washing things, like getting rid of invisible
germs and other e-mail worms living on the surface of fruits and meat (whose
existence every true Frier would deny), or money washing, which sounded much
better than laundering; or, the best of all, diluting one part mercury in nine
parts water, and then diluting one part of this mixture in nine parts water again,
and again, and again, until the whole thing turned into a block of gold. (Some
tried, but it never happened, not least because water and mercury don’t mix too
well.) Now this endeavour was tricky because water was known to cause short-circuits
and rusting, and was the cause of many fatalities, but the Washers’ patented
wash-it-and-throw-it-away diet proved to be quite popular, which happened to
prescribe that of all aliments, rice was the most important to be washed, or
else.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Before long everyone in Anaktor knew about the debate around rice.
The mayor had to issue an official ban on rice throwing at weddings,
as the mere sight of the dreaded cereal was enough to upset guests and spark
off fiery debates and violent fights. A week into what everyone started to call—after
the sensationalist headline of a tabloid—the
War of Rice,
the police had to
dismantle some traffic lights that showed red or green according to the culinary
persuasion of the approaching driver.</p>

<p class="pnorm">As more and more robots
began to shun the ones on the other side, and
call them
 torturers and perpetrators
of crimes against ricekind, 
 it became more and more difficult for Adda and Cynd to stay unseen and safely spend some time together.
  Instead, they sent lengthy secret messages: Cynd wooed Adda as ‘a rich jewel
in the ear of the Cosmos,’ and Adda tried her pen at poetry. In one of her love
poems evoking the fire in his gaze, she wrote:</p><p class="vsmallskip">
Two of the fairest stars in all the skies,<br/>
Having some business, may persuade his eyes<br/>
To twinkle in their place for them instead…<br/>
What if his eyes were there; they in his head?
</p><p class="psmallskip">It went on and on, but this vision alone was enough to scare the shit out of
poor Cynd, who was all the more bewildered because he couldn’t really understand
what the poet wanted to say.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But it all ended when their fathers, 
 Ricco and Elb,
  found the children’s little 
 eight-legged messenger bots
hiding under their beds, and decided to take them away for a
whole week amid much crying and stomping and metallic sparks. But it all had
little effect in the long run.</p>

<p class="pnorm">For whenever Lady Luck was on their side, they still managed to arrange a brief
rendezvous. On these occasions, they usually met in
 an abandoned office building
on Edgwire Road,
and, having climbed over the railing and through a broken window,
 they brought to life all the printers, telephones, calculators and electric
staplers, and ruled over them in an imaginary kingdom where everyone was equal
(except for them, as someone had to be in charge, and for the paper puncher,
who always picked holes in their speeches to their subject office equipment).</p>

<p class="pnorm">Then they would just sit there, hand in hand, under the flickering light-blue
neon lights, forgetting the scattered spreadsheets, chairs and buzzing fax machines,
and talk about the things to come.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘When I grow up, I want to be an engineer,’ 
 Cynd
  said, ‘and I’ll build the best house in the world for us.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, <i>I</i> want to be an engineer,’ 
 Adda
  pouted. ‘I’ll build a machine that can broadcast sense into everyone’s mind
so they would be nice to each other.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We can both be engineers.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh yes, we can, can’t we?’ Adda said, and laughed. ‘We’d move in the house you’ve
built, and have lots of children! And they’d be better than anyone else, because
we’d know how to make them perfect.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was a moment of silence before Cynd squeezed 
 Adda’s ivory-coloured hand
 a bit more, and looked at her.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Would you really like to build children with me?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda was no longer young enough not to comprehend the weight of the question.
She looked into 
 Cynd’s blue eyes,
 and suddenly felt as if she was falling weightlessly into the depths of his
starry gaze with an ever-increasing speed, flying through a universe without
black matter amid galaxies of happiness and common good. Her nod was hardly visible,
and her ‘yes’ hardly audible, but they made Cynd Washer the happiest machine
this side of the Great Void.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Just minutes after they’d got home,
  a special edition of a topical debate show started on the newscloud, where celebrities
and scientists specialising in carbon-based life forms took up the debate about
rice. There was a deputy advisor from the Court who made a brief remark about
the nonsensical nature of the matter at hand, and then remained silent for the
rest of the show. But questions from the studio audience overwhelmed the rest
of the panellists, and, at one point, a security guard had to intervene when
a heated exchange almost lead to Ms Hill, a Version Three-Five ex-actress and
a promoter of the washing diet attacking Mr Taylor, a teenage star who had unfortunately
grown up, but had suddenly developed a flair for frying, with an inflatable prop
dinosaur.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Looking back on these events, it seems that this debate played a twofold role
in the history of Glaucon. On the one hand, it instantly spread the debate from Anaktor
across the whole kingdom. On the other, it was the very last time
someone dared to sound the conviction in public that this rice-thing might not
be the most important question of all. There was, for example, the uncertainty
about the meaning of existence; the question about Life, the Universe, and Everything;
and then, of course, if you want fries with that. And as it was less and less
possible to say that it was a non-issue, it was less and less possible to think
so as well. Allegedly, there were underground meetings organised for the rice-deniers,
where they would sit in a circle and share stories before chanting ‘Wash or fry?
Die, die, die!’ for hours on end, but then someone pointed out that even denying
the importance of rice was <i>about</i> rice, and that all the denying actually
made it more important, so the meetings were stopped, and these unfortunate creatures
were heard of no more.</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was no longer any need for robots on one side to talk to or interact, in a civilised way, with those on the other.
Society filed for divorce from itself
on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour, which was to
be demonstrated based on the culinary practices of the parties. The secretary
of the Royal Society of Science, who happened to be the father of the ex-wife-to-be,
argued that a failure to follow universally accepted ways of preparing food by
washing it was a sign of anti-social tendencies, aggression and dementia, and
went on to present photographs taken of the husband performing the rice ritual.
His statement had the
immediate effect that half of the members of the Society resigned, and founded
the Royal Society of the Sciences, with Emphasis on the Plural, and asked their
doyen, who, by mere coincidence, was a close friend of the husband, to deliver
a speech entitled ‘The Essential Role of Fire and Frying in Turning Carbon-Based
Life Forms into Machine-Degradable Matter.’ The courtroom was first filled with
excited chatter and disbelief at the husband’s folly, then things turned, and
the spectators started to laugh at the stupidity of the wife. There was no golden
mean. You sided with either the woman or the man, and waited anxiously for the
divorce to be granted. And it was, without further ado.</p>

<p class="pnorm">As society went its separate ways, everything had to be divided. Apart from the
two science societies, there were now two state-owned radio stations, two cab
firms in each city and district, and some even suggested that there were two
countries at exactly the same geographical location. But as always, deciding
what belonged to whom in a household during a divorce was not an easy thing to
do.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick, the CEO of Monopoil, the company that took care of extracting and selling
the oil,
  had its fair share of the divorce proceedings. Being convinced that the King
would have no option but to accept the Friers’ gift, he paid a short social visit
to Pattero, presenting him with a bottle of fortified oil from the marvellous
34782 vintage. 
 His son, Thom—who had not followed in his father’s footsteps, but, instead,
had decided to pursue his dream of becoming a freethinker and existentialist playwright, but had had to sell
his body, one plate at a time, to support his children as his plays had never really got on—so,
  he heard about his father’s latest whim on the local newscloud. Or, to be precise,
about what he hoped to be a whim.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So, I hear you’ve got rid of another 34782 bottle,’ he greeted his 
 father in the luxurious executive office decorated with marble and leather and
a wallpaper that made it look rather like a tawdry honeymoon suite.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Never had a better investment,’ Mr Slick said, offering 
 his stumpy, limp hand attached to a short arm.
 ‘What brings you to this side of town? I haven’t got a bob.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Thom ignored the habitual remark. ‘You might’ve picked the wrong party.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What party?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You know what I’m talking about.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I might, but then, I might not. And I sure as hell haven’t got the time to listen
to you hinting about the bush.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, for crying out loud, look at those snotty scabs you’re playing up to now!
All they’ve got is that laughable air factory and a firm belief that they alone
guard the Secret of all Secrets.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick stopped pretending to be busy for a second, and stood there, perplexed,
with 
 all the transistors behind his shiny forehead
 running to and fro looking up every bit in his memory. ‘Oh,’ he said finally,
‘that rice thing.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Exactly.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, they all seem to be wound up about it for some reason.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘For some reason? Can’t you see they’re a bunch of delusional pyromaniacs? And
you sided with <i>them!’</i></p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They like to fry their rice. They’ve got every right to do that if they want
to.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Fry rice!’ Thom shouted in horror. ‘Fry rice!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick started to lose his temper. ‘Well, I happen to like some oil on my rice,
too.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I can’t believe you just said that.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It might have something to do with this company.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Then I don’t want to have anything to do with it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t worry, you don’t. You’ve decided to be free. What that means is that you
want the money, but don’t want to know how it’s made. Well, I’m sorry, but you
can’t make rivets and not use some metal.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, I hope it’s nice to live on rivets, because that’s all you have now.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s not that bad, thank you for asking,’ Mr Slick retorted. ‘I notice you’ve
got less and less of them. And, while we’re at it, how do you think rice is supposed
to be cooked?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What’s wrong with washing it?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, there’s a real free thinker, above all the petty quarrels and material constraints!’
Mr Slick said triumphantly. ‘You’re mad at me because you’ve sided with the Washers.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, at least they have a say at the Court.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And as for me,’ Mr Slick announced flatly, ‘I think the Friers may be the next
big thing in this country.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No,’ Thom said, stepping back. ‘You wouldn’t do that.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m not doing anything.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’ll help them. You’d sell your soul to the highest bidder.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’re selling your body.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was a moment of awkward silence as Thom took another step back.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘This was the last time you saw me.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s been a pleasure.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">After the door had closed, and a few seconds had passed, Mr Slick noticed a little
piece of metal gleaming on the marble floor. 
 Puffing, he bent down with difficulty to pick it up.
 He recognised it in an instant. It was a tiny piece from Thom’s little finger.
Carefully, he carried it back to his desk, put it in a paper handkerchief, and
folded it to form a little bundle. Then, he looked around, and found an envelope
in the top drawer. He put the tiny packet into it, checked once more whether
the piece was still in there, and carefully sealed the envelope. He spent some
time applying duct tape to its corners and edges before he slipped it into his
vest-pocket, making a mental note to have a little box made, maybe of steel and
velvet, lest the tiny piece should somehow get lost.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Although the divorce was final, it felt as if the husband hadn’t moved out—both
the Washer and the Frier sympathisers needed a way
of ensuring that they didn’t accidentally meet or see anyone from the opposite camp.
They didn’t need to wait long.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was
 Milo Frier, the left-handed Kantro’s middle-aged son 
with a remarkably large, round head,
  who first thought of choosing a single symbol to make official badges for themselves
and like-minded fellow Friers. He suggested an abstract drop of oil, as it was
necessary to fry rice, but it was also intended to hint at the budding relationship
between the family and Monopoil. The Washers had a harder time selecting a suitable
emblem. They agreed outright that an actual washer was out of the question, but
couldn’t settle on anything more specific. Mumha liked the idea of a pot very
much; Elb suggested a tap or a lead pipe, but the family assembly selected Cynd’s
suggestion, a flame, which represented freedom and power, and was also needed
to boil water for their preferred way of cooking.</p>

<p class="pnorm">So both families ordered the badges, enough for themselves and some more for
friends and patrons, and urged everyone else to do the same.
The badges etched the front line clearly and visibly on the social
map of Sayn’s kingdom. In a way, this was good. Unpleasant surprises and genuine
argumentation suddenly became few and far between. You knew whom you were dealing with straight
away, and either instantly hated them for no apparent reason and turned aside,
or loved them for no apparent reason and greeted them with a wink and a smile.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Or, rather, it had that effect on the Friers until they saw the badges the Washers
had designed. Their hearts sank at the sight of the small flame. They immediately
realised how powerful a symbol fire was: full of strength, potential, and cultural
references. In contrast, oil looked sleek, slimy, and somehow inferior. Having
run out of ideas themselves, they decided to do something really iniquitous.
They had badges made that had not one, but three tongues of flame, and were much
bigger than the Washers’ ones as well. Then, they painted their house red and
yellow, and organised a torchlight procession through the city. Their strategy
was successful. Soon the Washers’ single flame was regularly mistaken for the
Frier emblem, and the Washers were forced to abandon their original idea, and
choose water as their sign, which was a more suitable symbol for washing anyway.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Adda started running toward Cynd as soon as she caught a glimpse of him at their
next rendezvous on Edgwire Road.
  But instead of stopping when they met halfway, she simply ran into him and knocked
him over.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Loser!’ she laughed, and continued running.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd, more stunned than hurt, got to his feet, and dashed after her. By the time
he caught up with Adda, she was already busy removing her flame badge, hiding
in a short alley just off the main road. Her eyes were frightened when she looked
up.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Cynd! I’m so sorry. I hope you’re not hurt or anything.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, but what’s gotten into you?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">She dropped the badge in her pocket. ‘I forgot to get rid of this damn thing.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And you’re wearing yours,’ she pointed at Cynd’s chest. ‘And it would’ve been
pretty suspicious if we hadn’t been fighting.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd wasn’t sure what to say.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m sorry, Cynd,’ Adda repeated. Her voice faltered as she turned away. ‘I so
wish this whole thing wasn’t true.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Mikke Beetemle,
 the Chancellor himself, was also busy hiding which side he was on. Before he
left his 
residence
  for an emergency meeting in a dilapidated warehouse, he got a servant to spray
graffiti all over his body in an attempt to disguise himself as a drunkard fallen
victim to a practical joke.</p>



<a name="b1c4"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book1.gif" class="img1"/></p><h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">The Chancellor,
 sufficiently camouflaged, tapped the pre-arranged binary code on 
the rusty door
 of the warehouse. It was
Elb
 who let the latecomer in, and led him down a 
creaking escalator
 into the cellar 
the Washers had selected
 as the place for the meeting.</p>

<p class="pnorm">As Mikke’s eyes got used to the darkness (the cheap fluorescent equations hung
from the ceiling didn’t help much), he recognised 
 Mumha, who was seated on a pile of wooden crates, as well as Cynd and his mother,
Nida, sitting patiently on an empty oil barrel among the other robots.
  Nida had warm blue eyes, which contrasted with her tall ruler-like body that
reflected her profession perfectly.
She was an engineer at the Civil Factory, with legs that were
envied by all of her colleagues, even the male ones.
  And then there was 
 Aved Hhan, an elderly professor of cyberiology and a distant relative of the family;
 Jot Nifli, the Lord Steward of HM Sayn,
and six or seven other robots, each of whom was wearing
the distinctive wave-shaped badge.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Mikke!’ Mumha greeted him. ‘I’m so happy you could make it. Sorry for not getting
up. I’m rusty, and I don’t like oil. Anyway, I’m so happy to see you here. It
wasn’t easy to get everyone together. We chose this place so that those from
the Court could get here without the Friers screaming about undue influence over
the King.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mikke smiled, and nodded towards the Lord Steward, and another robot he recognised
as one of the grooms of Mr Godnor. Mumha turned toward the little group, and
clapped her hands.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hi, everyone! The Right Honourable Mikke Beetemle has finally arrived to honour
us with his presence, so I’d like us to start straight away. As you probably
all know, our good friends at the Court have heard rumours that Sayn is considering
accepting the Friers’ so-called gift, which I think we have every reason to call
a bribe.’ A couple of boos and hisses interrupted her, but Mumha gestured the
robots to remain silent. She continued, ‘I don’t blame the King: the Court is
short of money, and, under normal circumstances, I’d much rather he accepted
some stuff from a bunch of oiks than raised the taxes. But, needless to say,
it would be disastrous for us if he accepted the bribe, and we must prevent it
in any way we can.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So let’s form a little network, put our processors
together, and figure out something.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">So they formed a circle to 
 start a round table-discussion without an actual table,
  and let their thoughts jump to and fro between their heads on glowing blue filaments
suspended mid-air.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I think,’ started Elb, speaking as if he was balancing his words, ‘that we should also offer something to the King. That
way, it would be clear to him that the Friers’ bribe would make him part of this
war.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But he knows that already,’ Mikke’s brassy voice echoed off the walls. ‘That
is why, very wisely, he’s so far refrained from reacting to the gift in either
way, even though he promised a quick reply to the Friers. If he accepts it, he’ll
enrage those on our side. If he rejects it, he’ll alienate himself from Friers
and co.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And why would that be so bad?’ asked Aved, somewhat condescendingly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It wouldn’t be bad. But perhaps it’d help if we offered something better than
them.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">And so a desperate discussion started as they tried to find a suitable gift.
The Washers had no money. There were a few more among their ranks from the upper
crust, and had more influence in politics than the Friers, but that was all;
and they really felt the need to put all their eggs in one basket if they wanted
to avoid ending up with some on their faces. After two hours of brainstorming
and arguing, putting things on a list and crossing them out, considering insider
info and an outsider’s point of view; when Mumha’s battery started to ache, and
the others were dying for a refreshing sip of electrolyte, as a last act of desperation,
they agreed to offer everything that was still on their list to the King. It
represented the brightest gems of their knowledge and expertise—the only thing
the Washers could afford to give away—that they thought might interest Sayn.
As they broke up the meeting, they pinned all their hopes on appealing to a little-known
weakness of the King: that he’d always wanted to go down in history as the Great
Sayn, the Undefeatable Commander and Conqueror of Neighbouring Things.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">In the corner, 
 Cynd
  shuddered as he felt the weight of a hand on his shoulder. He opened his eyes.
Nida was gone; it was Mikke who’d woken him up.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hello, young man,’ Mikke said. ‘How was the meeting?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, hi, Mr Beetemle. I must’ve slept through the second part.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mikke offered his hand because Cynd’s legs hadn’t come out of stand-by yet.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Listen, I wanted to ask you something.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Uh, sure,’ Cynd nodded as he stood up and scrambled onto the escalator.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What do you think of Adda?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Alarm bells started to ring in Cynd’s mind. His pale blue eyes widened, and he
was suddenly fully awake.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Adda? She’s nice. Why?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Nice?’ Mikke asked. Cynd felt him logging in to his mind, and taking a look
around.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I see,’ he mumbled, knit his eyebrows, and logged out. ‘I’m sorry, Cynd, I wanted
to talk to you before it happened. Now it won’t be easy, but I don’t want you
to meet Adda again. I think it would be best for both of you. And for the family.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But why?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I think you know why.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well,’ Cynd replied, mimicking the favourite sentence of the courtiers, ‘I’ll
see what I can do.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t talk back to me,’ Mikke snarled. ‘I may go and talk to your father about
this.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Please,’ pleaded Cynd, ‘please don’t bring dad into this, Mr Beetemle.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The Right Honourable,’ Mikke rebuked the brazen youth. Cynd grabbed at him in
a vain attempt to stop him, but the Chancellor was already gone.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Outside, he saw 
 his father
  and Mikke walking away, deep in conversation. Elb looked at him, but Cynd didn’t
dare to go any closer.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Soon after 
Mikke
 had returned to his residence on the Filehall, and then made his way back to
the Court stinking of paint thinner in his formal quicksilver uniform,
 and after Nida and Elb had both got back from work,
 the ceremonial
procession of the 
Washer family and Aved Hhan, an unquestioned authority on all things rice, set
 off from the other side of Screen Park towards the 
Royal Palace.
 Instead of a briefcase packed with galactic trinkets, they carried a giant flip chart
easel that was remarkably good at competitive dancing, and markers and laser
pointers in all the colours of the rainbow. 
 Sayn
  seemed unusually happy to receive them, and everyone quickly found their starting
positions in the 
 presence chamber
  to perform the usual choreography of the high hopes and elusive remarks of a
corporate presentation.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The Washers put on their best show. They used animated charts and creative statistics,
twelve-dimensional projections and user-friendly language, augmented reality
and diminished imagination to present what they had to offer. Sayn was on the
edge of his slate throne when 
 Nida and Elb
  explained that they had developed a secret, powerful weapon with which he could
conquer the neighbouring stars and planetary systems. Imagine his surprise and
dismay when he learned that the secret weapon was—rice. And plenty of it.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We <i>are</i> sorry,’ he forced himself to say, ‘for a moment we thought you
said it was rice.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cue music; it was time for 
 Aved’s
  solo step dance.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Think of it this way, Your Majesty,’ he explained, ‘multitude is strength. One
mere grain of rice, just this large, does not amount to much. Just like an atom.
If I happened to throw a
<sup>56</sup>Fe
 atom at you, nothing would happen. But what if I threw a cannon ball? It would
have, if I may say so, a much greater impact. And the same holds for rice. We
don’t plan to use a handful—what effect would it have apart from some minor
annoyance? We’re proposing to use tons and tons in projectile weapons.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The King still couldn’t believe his ears. ‘So you suggest that we throw rice
at enemy soldiers?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are we marrying them?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Aved panicked. The pitch fell out of tune, and the dance got out of sync. ‘No,
no, nothing like that. I mean…’ He checked himself: he didn’t know what
the King’s secret desires might be. So he quickly added, ‘Although that might
not be an ineffective tactic either. What we are thinking of is to simply shoot
them with rice.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Rice has a number of advantages over usual projectiles. First of all, it’s much
cheaper.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But it’s softer than metal!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It can still do a considerable amount of damage. And, if we use enough, it’ll
also confuse the enemy, because that amount of rice is something they’ve never
seen before.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Sayn remained unconvinced of the plausibility of the suggestion, and put on a
sez-you expression. 
 Cynd
  moved to the next soundtrack, and Aved began a hesitation waltz to get around
the problem. He cited his expertise in cyberiology and nutritional engineering,
and, with the help of the others, went on to present the rest of what was on
their list.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He introduced one of their recent inventions, the territorial rice, which spreads
so quickly that no other organism or machine has the slightest chance of survival
on a planet under attack. But the King said that he enjoyed the thrill of battles.
Then he unveiled their latest project—still in beta testing, but showing great
promise—, the sticky rice, which helps defeating an enemy army by slowing them
down. But the King said that soldiers under attack were hardly likely to wait
patiently until the rice grew around them. And then it was the end of the Washers’
list. There was nothing else to offer.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The King had already paid more attention to a tiny, gilded royal messenger bot
than the guests, and when he released it and it scuttled into a hole under the
throne, the Washers decided to admit defeat and take French leave. But before
they could gather their props and get back to the green room, the messenger reappeared,
and the King motioned them to stay where they were.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The golden bot climbed on top of the armrest of the throne. The King carefully
held it between two fingers, and placed it on his left palm to connect to it.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You know what,’ he said, ‘we’ve just done a quick search, and there doesn’t
seem to be anyone who’ve used rice as a weapon. We think it could add an element
of surprise and take the enemy off-guard.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh yes, yes indeed!’ Elb said eagerly, ‘Imagine, Your Majesty, what chaos such
a surprise could cause in their ranks!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We think so, too,’ smiled the King, with images of victorious marches and cheering
subjects flashing in front of his eyes. ‘We think you should take these projects
in that direction. Surprise!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The Washers bowed; 
Aved grinned at Elb; Elb smiled at Nida; Nida looked at her son,
 picturing him as a handsome officer decorated with the Cross of the 
N<sup>th</sup>
 Order, and Cynd looked at his toes wondering how much longer this whole thing
would take.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But we mustn’t get over-excited,’ said the King; ‘we are to follow the customary
protocol, and will reply to your offer having consulted our household. We thank
you warmly for your visit, and bid you good-bye.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Both families spent the next week waiting for the King’s decision. They didn’t
do much apart from that, and from trying to avoid anyone associated with the
other family like the plague.
Their followers were much less timid, though, and pushed the debate in a new direction.
Incidents on buses, in pubs, and in queues in front of softwarehouses were common
occurrences. Scuffles regularly broke out between prowling gangs at fountains
and oil wells, as sympathisers either tried to protect or destroy objects with
clear symbolic meanings. And it didn’t help that Mr Slick publicly endorsed the
Frier agenda, either. He claimed he’d had no choice, as oil had a demonstrable
aversion to water, and no matter where oil went, Monopoil had to follow.</p>

<p class="pnorm">On one occasion, 
 two elderly ladies met at a bus stop,
  both out and proud, one wearing a little flame, the other a wavelet. They hadn’t
the intention to let an insult such as the presence of someone different than
themselves pass unnoticed, and they grabbed the heavy brick-shaped magnets hidden
in their handbags, and magnetised each other so thoroughly that the paramedics
had to use crowbars and speed cutters to pry them apart. The incident received
much publicity across the kingdom, after which the
King
 was quick to summon both families to 
the Court.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘My rebellious subjects,’ 
 Sayn
  began, ‘enemies of peace! We wish you would bury the hatchet and that harmony
be restored, so that we could live once more in peace like we used to do.
Now, however, our wish is more than a wish:
for we believe that the time has come to take a
step back, back and forward towards peace.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He was standing in the elliptical Feedback Hall, where intricate patterns on
the quartz floor marked the two foci of the room.
 His sound was reverberated
and amplified by the geometric walls,
and was intended to awe
 Mumha, Pattero, their families and the dignitaries
 called to the King’s presence.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Towards peace,’ Sayn continued, ‘and towards harmony; a country where
food does not make us enemies of ourselves, but makes us unite
around the tables of homes, families, and of our great nation.
Where seeds of rice are not seeds of hatred sown in the circuits of our
fellow citizens, but seeds from which peace and plenty blossom
when they reach the fertile grounds of our souls.
Let us wish for that country, and let us step into that country now!</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘My peace-loving subjects! For I know deep in my heart that none of you wish
to go down in history as the one that used a mere grain to try to derail
our country and plunge it into the abyss of troubled times.
Peace will prevail, so step into the future, and join us in celebrating the unity that belongs to all
of us, all the descendants of Version One from the golden age of Pre-Alpha.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You all know that the family of Mumha has long been welcome at our Court, and
that our politics, as well as these buildings themselves, bear the marks of their
beneficial influence. However, to our no hidden disappointment, it is their feud
with Pattero’s family that is troubling the streets of our cities. We ask you, as
we ask the other side, to look upon each other as each other’s brethren; and
so as to set an example, we hereby welcome Pattero and his family to our Court
as well, and invite them to participate in its daily life. Moreover, in order
for them to leave a tangible mark, we have decided to place in our collection
of rarities the articles they have so kindly offered to us.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Sayn looked around, waiting for the effect of his words. He smiled, but his spirits
were low. He really fancied the new weapons of the Washers, but what he really
needed was the income from the oil export. It was just after the end of the tax
year, and the revenues turned out to be less than predicted. Raising the rates
was out of the question because he was adamant about keeping his approval rating
high, and the Friers’ trinkets, although they looked nice, didn’t come close
to the billions necessary to balance the sheets. He needed the oil, too. And
that meant treating Mr Slick and his chosen people well.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But it turned out to be bad news for the approval rating anyway. For the King
had just lost the support of exactly half of his robots.</p>



<a name="b1c5"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book1.gif" class="img1"/></p><h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">The sky was dark and tempestuous and unnaturally blue as three robots trooped
up to the patch of wild screensavers, passed them, and entered the no-go area.
Clad in superconducting sheets for protection, they were all wearing stock heads
so that they couldn’t be identified. And one of the real heads waiting patiently
on a kitchen table for its owner to return was that of 
 Cynd Washer.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The screensavers that bloomed in the vacant lot halfway up Cable Street had gained
a certain notoriety due to their convenient placement between the houses of Mumha
and Pattero, which meant that they’d soon come to mark the border between the
Washer and the Frier ghettos. Move one step this way, and you were shouted at,
spat on and kicked in the teeth. Move one step that way, and it was you who punched
the intruder in the face. There were ‘Washers keep out!’ signs on one side, and
‘A thought a day keeps a Frier away’ painted on the walls on the other.</p>

<p class="pnorm">One of the three robots 
was
 Dul, Aved’s son.
He was all worked up, and kept shaking his fist at the shuttered
windows and secured doors.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘If any of them comes close, mate,’ he shouted, ‘I’ll shut them down with these
two hands.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You don’t need to shut them down; you just don’t fucking wind them up! Eh,
 Braxon?’ laughed Cynd, nudging the skinny third robot
 with his elbow. His face heated up with the excitement, and he’d completely
forgotten the little screensaver bud hidden in his hand that he’d picked from
the patch.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Get up here, losers! You’re clockwork! You hear me? Clockwork! Tick-tock!’ Dul
and Braxon shouted in the deserted street.</p>

<p class="pnorm">A window was shut closed, and they bellowed with laughter. They tore down posters,
kicked in fences, and generally made as much noise and nuisance as they could.
Then they turned into a narrow lane that led to the edge of an allotment. There
stood a dilapidated hut built from corrugated sheets. They knocked on the makeshift
door, and an old robot answered from within. Instead of a reply, Dul tore up
the door.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How do you cook rice?’ he asked the old robot.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t cook rice,’ the robot creaked. ‘I’ve got no rice. I wish I had. Now
go away.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You know what we mean. Are you a Washer or a Frier?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m not a Frier.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You live in the middle of the ghetto, mate.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘This was the only place I could put this hut up. And I like it here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So you like it here?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Not a Frier? Fuckin’ liar!’ they chanted, grabbed the wretched thing, and threw
him out into a nearby ditch. The poor man, with his side dented and neck bent,
scrambled to his feet, and hobbled away mumbling curses under his breath. Dul
sprayed ‘Washer territory! Keep out!’ on the hut in large, blue letters, and
they gave three cheers for themselves.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Look ’ere!’ Braxon pointed at a house as they got back to the street. It was
the Frier family home. The other two had already started picking up stones and
tiles from the front garden and pelting the door and the windows when Cynd got
there. ‘This is for bribing the King!’ Dul shouted when one of the ground floor
windows burst into a shower of splinters. ‘Hooray!’ Cynd was about to yell, but
the sound stuck in his throat.</p>

<p class="pnorm">For in that moment, Adda’s face appeared in a window left open on the first floor.
He hadn’t dared to contact her since Mikke and then his father had talked to
him at the secret meeting. And, after the King’s announcement, he hadn’t thought
he wanted to anymore.</p>

<p class="pnorm">She peeped down, and shrilled, with her voice quavering, ‘Who’s there? Leave
us alone!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd just stood there like someone who hasn’t booted up fully yet.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hey, what’s up?’ Dul asked. Cynd looked at him, and looked up again. The face
was gone.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He swung back his arm, and flung the bud through the top window just before it
was closed with a loud click.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Nice move! Whadicha throw in?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I dunno,’ Cynd replied. ‘Just something I’d got.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Such forays into enemy territory became regular events. Behind locked doors and
barred windows, millions were riveted to the newscloud watching the more and
more violent clashes happening in front of their houses, and their own and their
neighbour’s cars being overturned and set alight. The smell of steam and burning
oil, the sound of car alarms and sirens seeped through the windows, and settled
in the rooms and houses that had once been called homes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Elb and Cynd
 were arrested and released without charge five times that week, and 
Dul
 was locked up twice for carrying an opened can of electrolyte.
  Braxon, who was trying to get home from school after his first weed, giggling and hugging everything
that got in his way, was hit in the shoulder by a mounted policeman so hard that
his parents had to get a turner to make a brand new joint for him. 
 His father, a certain Mikke Beetemle,
 went through the roof, and tried to have the chief police officer sacked on
the grounds of incompetence. He couldn’t get anywhere, though, and the King refused
to talk to him for three whole hours for attempting to influence an independent
police investigation. The Friers also had some trouble with the police. 
Ricco
 narrowly avoided receiving a verbal warning after he’d poured fetid refuse oil
on the asphalt in a busy intersection in the Washer ghetto, causing a predictable
series of smash-ups. 
Milo
 was less lucky, and got fined for the equivalent of an hour’s wage when he kicked
the grandmother of one of 
Nida’s
 friends in the head so hard that her skull cracked, and some of her bits leaked
onto the pavement.</p>

<p class="pnorm">These developments got everyone thinking, and a tabloid used up all the front
page of its next edition to announce, in over-sized letters, ‘The Police Are
with the Friers—and So Are We,’ which immediately trebled its readership. The
police was quick to deny any bias.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We don’t discriminate,’ the chief police officer said, ‘but we treat everyone
as they deserve.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Slowly but steadily, the robots of the fire were winning. They laid 
 siege to Washer houses near the Frier ghetto.
  They regularly attacked and terrorised the occupiers until the Washers gave
up and moved away wherever they could, without even bothering to try to sell
their homes or lock them up—there wouldn’t have been much point in doing so.
Frier teenagers broke in anyway and used the rooms to smoke pans in until they
got tired of the wallpaper and kicked the place into pieces.</p>

<p class="pnorm">While life in the countryside was still manageable, the capital appeared to have
adopted a strange cycle of hours of rioting, then cleaning up the debris, and
then hammering out the victims and rioters who weren’t quick enough. King Sayn’s
last attempt to get the situation under control was to impose a curfew, but it
failed miserably. As there were no days or nights, no one knew when it was supposed
to start, and that meant that the police were now free to apprehend anyone for
breaking it. And somehow those anyones always turned out to be Washers.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It must’ve been just when the news broke that an old man, pleading in vain a
couple of Frier teenagers to let him near an outlet, discharged beyond repair,
and no one was accused of murder, that the first brick flew through the window
of 
 Cynd
  Washer’s room. Leaving a trail of glistening glass behind, it landed neatly
on the bed. A cursory glance was enough for Cynd to see that it was from their
dilapidated fence.
 The brick used to sit on the edge of the column that supported
the rusty gate, and it still bore the markings he’d once made with the tip of
his finger on the way back from school, after he’d been beaten up for the second
time.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He heard shouting coming from outside.</p>

<p class="pnorm">As he rushed down to the living room, an ear-splitting clang filled the air,
and a dent appeared in the metal entrance door. It was clear that it was about
to give in to the weight of the robots trying to break into their house. 
 Nida just stood there, her warm brown eyes filled with terror,
 and clasped her son tightly in her arms. But 
 Elb
  didn’t lose his head. He sent Mumha to the back room, cleared his throat, and
opened the door.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Can I help you?’ he asked. 
 He was short, but quite sturdy, and stood in the doorway with hands akimbo,
 facing a group of 
about twenty robots carrying
 straightened scythes and baseball bats. A second passed in ominous silence.
It was Cynd who spotted the arm raising a self-defence sparker and aiming it
at Elb. He wrestled himself out of his mother’s arms, ran past his father, and
jumped at the attacker, kicking and biting in every direction. The Friers closed
around him. A door was shut. A white arc lit up inside his brain,
and his processors started to execute his earlier memories, which ended in what
programmers fear the most, a coma-like sleep and a segmentation fault.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Adda
  had long been gone. She’d stolen out of their house in a dressing gown after
she’d heard what had happened at Mumha’s house. She passed the mostly inanimate
body of Cynd hidden in the overgrowth three times; once she even tripped in a
finger that his half-awake brain moved to extend as it registered a familiar
form. Half mad with worry, she zigzagged the deserted streets that lay between
the two ghettoes, not daring to call Cynd’s name or to call for help.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was 
 Nida
  who found the boy. Crouching down, with shaking hands she unlocked
  the little cover on his chest, pushed a few buttons,
 and started running a couple of checks.
She had to hurry to get 
 Cynd
  back to safety, so she forced herself to approach the problem as the experienced
engineer that she was in her job, helping innumerable patients and machines.
Hours seemed to have passed until the tests finished, but she was relieved to
find that only a couple of memory segments were faulty. She quickly deleted them,
obliterating most of the events of the previous hours for Cynd, touched the little
pendant on her necklace that used to belong to her mother to give her luck, and
pushed the blue button.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘There’s a strong boy; there’s a strong boy,’ she kept murmuring as she followed
all the system messages while Cynd was booting up.</p>

<p class="pnorm">How proud she was when Cynd was up and running again! As they were walking back
to the house, a
tiny blue spark sneaked past the engineer’s self-control and appeared in the corner of her eye—she was so proud
of her son that he was brave enough to try to defend his father, and she was
so proud of him that he was strong enough to survive his bravery.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But they say that every silver lining has a cloud. After they found 
 Elb,
  who’d been looking for Cynd to the north of their house, and they returned home,
 Mumha
  showed them a note that someone had slipped under the door. It simply said,
in so many words, that the Friers would be back.</p>

<p class="pnorm">After what they’d been through, everyone felt cheerful and relieved as the family
packed their most valuable belongings in four small suitcases, as they took a
bath, put on their Sunday best, and walked out the door leaving their home behind
for good. They knew exactly where they were going: 
 Chancellor Beetemle
  was kind enough to offer a couple of rooms in his residence to the family. His
palace was conveniently located on the Filehall in the middle of the Washer ghetto,
and they very much hoped that they’d be safe there for a while.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda
  only heard that they were gone after the Frier mob had gone back to Mumha’s
house, and had found it empty. Her batteries had almost run out, but she still
couldn’t force herself to rest. She’d already reprogrammed all her messenger
bots to scuttle to Cynd’s room, send some photos back, and start looking for
him; but the city was big, and the bots were small, and two of them got trampled
on in the first hour of the search. She wished she knew something about Cynd,
anything at all, but she had no idea what else to do, how to get into the other
ghetto or ask around without attracting a lot of suspicion.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Meanwhile, life hobbled on. The police kept harassing 
 Cynd, Braxon, Dul
  and the other Washer teenagers on a regular basis. They got stopped, searched,
fined or done in for a variety of reasons, like carrying a bottle of water, which
was obviously a deadly weapon in the wrong hands; or a bottle of oil, which was
obviously a disguised bottle of water; or for not carrying any bottle at all,
which obviously meant that they’d hidden the water somewhere else. They now spent
most of their time at home, but the angry and frustrated messages they sent to
each other formed a whirling underground swarm of bots. They devised a number
of ways of taking revenge, often with the tacit approval or even the encouragement
of their parents, but it was when 
 Aved Hhan decided to cancel his classes at the university, take the lead and his students and show the planet
that the Washers were not to be messed with that the young really got full of bits and vinegar.
Aved’s plan was to tackle their enemies one by one, and focus
on the bots in blue first. The idea was to surround the cop shop at the end of
Cable Street, demand an apology, and see what happens.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He composed a petition and had already printed a couple of copies when the
Washers started to gather around the police station. Most of them had their usual
superconductors on, and about a third had switched their heads as well—perhaps
they didn’t want them to get damaged, or they weren’t out as Washers at home.
Aved and 
 Dul
  arrived together, and 
 Cynd
  and 
 Braxon
  joined them in half an hour. Not much later, Aved spotted Mr Slick’s son, 
 Thom, in the 300-strong crowd, who hadn’t got a single plate left to cover his circuits.
Aved decided to send him straight home. The situation was likely to get out of
control.</p>

<p class="pnorm">There were 
 about fifteen bobbies
in the small two-storey brick building,
  and they were desperate already. At the very beginning, they’d tried to arrest
some of the protesters and take them into the station, but for every protester
nicked, five others had arrived, and the building had pretty soon begun to feel
like a packed train carriage during the rush hour. So they’d decided to let everyone
go, and were now less and less patiently waiting for some back-up—but the officers
sent there from other stations were held up in the traffic that was curiously
busy for that hour in the Washer ghetto. The crowd had swelled to about 900 in
the meantime.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Aved, accompanied by a third of the protesters, went up to the doors of the building,
knocked, and tried to bring it home to the officer on the other side of the rectangular
peep hole that he had a petition he wanted to present in which they were asking
for an official apology. A whining voice replied that a superior would have to
be asked, and then, as expected, nothing happened for half an hour.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The protesters automatically formed a wireless network, but, as the bit rate
of such networks is pretty low, and one can only transmit messages quite slowly,
they had to resort to short, memorable phrases to convey their feelings, which
were mainly anger and frustration. Therefore, they improvised a chant to a well-known
tune, and started to sing and bellow it with an ever-increasing volume. It ran
like this:</p><p class="vsmallskip">
This old clown, of this town,<br/>
Thinks his cops can tread us down;<br/>
Says he’ll treat you as you’re worth,<br/>
’N won’t discriminate:<br/>
Guess who’ll meet an awful fate!
</p><p class="psmallskip">The singing got better and better as they kept stealing away to a nearby pub
to keep their spirits up with some electrolyte and other concentrated refreshments.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Another half-hour passed. They took the state flag off the wall of the station,
and cheered. Then Cynd said they weren’t actually against the country, only against
the other half of it, so they put it back, and cheered again. And they still
waited for someone to come out and at least say hello.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They’re not coming out,’ Braxon said. ‘They don’t think we’re worth it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Fuck all the bastards!’ Dul shook his fist. ‘Just bring them out and I’ll show
them what fucking metal Washers are made of!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hey, if they’re not coming out, what about going in?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was an older robot speaking who’d left his real head at a safer place.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Others joined in. ‘Let’s go in! Let’s go in!’ they shouted. Someone started kicking
the heavy steel doors, but quickly gave up, and hobbled away. Aved quietly suggested
that it might be worth waiting a bit more, but the young Washers were fed up
with the arrogance of the police, and took matters in their own hands. 
 They got a steel bench,
  and used it as a battering ram to break through the door. It took over twenty
minutes to smash the lock to pieces and loosen the metal wings, but the door
eventually gave in. There was an ear-splitting acclamation as nearly a thousand
robots cheered their success.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Once they got through, they saw why it was so hard to break in: the officers
had erected a barricade of desks and boxes in the lobby to protect the entrance.
Otherwise, the building was empty. The fifteen policemen and policewomen were
nowhere to be found.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Obviously disappointed that they were not going to get their apology, the Washers
didn’t know what to do. Aved attempted an improvised speech under the whitewashed
archway in the lobby to raise their spirits, pointing out that they had, in fact,
won; but what was a victory without a single enemy captured, beaten, or at least
laughed at? Everyone had got pretty hungry during the half-hour siege, so they
left Aved, and gravitated around the cafeteria. First, they formed an orderly
queue, but when they realised that they didn’t have to pay, they smashed the
glass displays, and handed out the battery tarts by the dozen. The place was
ransacked; all movable stuff was gone, with the white-hot ovens, microwave torches
and absolute zero fridges all broken to pieces. Now this was rather unfortunate,
because the officers had not really left the building, as everybody thought,
but had dismantled themselves and disguised their bodies as kitchen appliances.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">The Royal Secret Service, naturally, followed the events closely via the miniature
cameras installed in their special spy clouds held in place by tiny metal balloons,
and reported to the 
 King
  every hour. They reported the death of one, two, then three policemen, then
that of two policewomen, who’d all fallen victims to the mindless vandalism of
the Washer youth and their own unfortunate choice of camouflage. They were the
first fatalities of the War of Rice, and, as the death toll climbed up to seven,
Sayn could hardly force himself to contemplate the immediate impact of the news
that was bound to break in just a couple of hours.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He declared a state of emergency with immediate effect, but as a curfew had already
been put in place, and he controlled the army and the police anyway, that didn’t
amount to much. 
 Mikke
  Beetemle urged the King to send the troops in, but Sayn was wary of attacking
a group of Washers, which would make him seem an ardent Frier supporter. But
by the time it had been established that no serving officer survived the incident,
the King had already regretted his lack of resolution. He felt personally responsible,
and Mr 
 Godnor
  had to literally restrain him to prevent him from sending hand-written apologetic
letters to all the families affected.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘This is a war,’ Mr Godnor said, ‘and there’s no war without casualties.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He took Sayn’s arm, and they retired to the 
 private chamber.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Sayn let 
 himself sink into his favourite, slightly overstuffed gilded armchair, which
was much more comfortable than the throne, and gazed absently at the swirling
patterns of the blue–green carpet intended to mimic the sky of Glaucon.
  Mr Godnor only knew that there was something wrong when their wireless connection
was lost, and the fans inside the King sped up to dissipate the heat. The royal
 physician,
  alerted by the monarchomonitor, rushed into the room, and diagnosed a short-circuit
in the left side of the King’s brain that caused a meltdown, damaging a processor
circuit. With Mr Godnor, they tried an immediate system restore, but failed because
much of the backup data was already corrupt; and there was no chance of replacing
the damaged part without altering Sayn’s personality, as it was a bespoke module
designed individually for each member of the royal family. It would take years
and years for Sayn to recover, and no one knew if he’d be able to rule his kingdom
again.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Adda
  even forgot to scream with joy when she noticed 
 the cubic head
 moving between the corrugated sheets and disembowelled washing machines down
below. A thick cloud cast a deep indigo shadow over the garden, but 
Adda
 recognised him without even actually looking there. It didn’t take her a second
to climb down from the roof of the back extension where she’d been sitting. She
opened her mouth to call out to 
 Cynd,
  but she checked herself, and their eyes met in complete silence.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Adda! You’re alright!’ 
Cynd
 said once he was holding her in his arms.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Shh,’ she whispered into his ear, ‘they’ll recognise your voice.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">An embrace was the only activity that allowed two robots to completely synchronise
their brain waves, and, by using their two minds as one, temporarily arrive at
a deeper understanding of life and the world. Those who experienced this state
usually claimed that it was the happiest second of their existence.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I was so worried,’ said Adda, when they finally parted. ‘I sent thousands of
messages, but all my bots came back unread.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thousands of messages! I wish I’d received them.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I didn’t know what else to do. Where do you live now? And what are you doing
here?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Me? At Mikke’s. I… I wanted to get to your place to see if you were okay.
Just dropped in to check what’s left of our house.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yeah, the rear garden’s a mess, but come on, don’t stand there. Someone might
see you. There are Friers everywhere here now.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And you?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m a Frier, don’t you remember?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yep. It’d be nice to forget it sometimes, though.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda stopped, and smiled. ‘Yes, it would be, wouldn’t it?’ she said, in a distant
voice. ‘Come on, we should get inside. Don’t worry, it’s a lot better than out
here. There was some fighting in the street a couple of hours ago.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So you’ve been inside, haven’t you?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, I have. I locked some of the rooms.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thanks.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No problem. Shall we go in?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, I don’t want to.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Okay,’ she sighed. ‘Let’s sit in that corner then. And we can talk, but really,
really low. My parents don’t know I’m here, and I’m sure they wouldn’t be thrilled.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yeah,’ he grinned. ‘Same here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">So they sat on the little concrete strip that skirted the house, where the back
wall met the extension, nervously ducking whenever someone passed the house on
the street. They didn’t do much talking, but Cynd took Adda’s hand, which, although
wasn’t as good as an embrace, was much-much better than nothing.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">‘The sky is beautiful,’ Mr 
 Godnor
  said, standing at the window. ‘It’s cloudy, and you can almost see the stars.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Indeed, a thick blue fluff of a cloud reduced the sun to a faint white disc,
and the moons of the planet and nearby stars managed to send their light through
the clear patches in the atmosphere.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The King,
  lying in their canopied bed under an oversized spiky heat sink like an inverted
fakir, smiled. He was still weak, and had no access to a large part of his memory,
but had no trouble recognising the man he loved so dearly, and was more than
willing for them to connect their minds in a wireless embrace.</p>

<p class="pnorm">An embrace still brought happiness, as it used to when they were young, but the
decades had taught them that the deeper understanding it seemed to make possible
was a mere illusion. For when two brains united, they didn’t see more than before;
on the contrary, they saw less—they only grasped things that both minds were
capable of comprehending. They didn’t become, so to speak, the least common multiple,
but the greatest common divisor. And the resulting, childish and slightly naïve
view of the world turned the cosmos into a very happy place indeed, and one would’ve
been a fool not to try to believe that it was what the universe was really like.
(Incidentally, the same process took place when more than two minds attempted
to unite, like in the notorious mobs of Version Two-Nought Beta robots, where
the greatest common divisor was usually one. But in such cases, the perceived
world was often quite an unhappy place for reasons that we cannot go into now.)</p>

<p class="pnorm">After the moment of embrace was over, and Mr Godnor had performed some routine
checks on Sayn (he was the only person allowed to log into the King), he turned
back to the sky. It wasn’t visible yet, and he hoped it’d never be, but he knew
somewhere up there something had changed.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">‘Don’t you think there’s something strange going on?’ 
 Adda
  asked, pointing at the hardly visible sun.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Only strange things go on now,’ 
 Cynd
  replied, ‘but that’s only a cloud.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, that’s not what I mean. That’s not where the sun used to be.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Maybe,’ he said, looking at Adda gently stroking her hair, ‘it’s trying to peer
through a clear patch to make the sky as bright as it should be.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Before turning her head toward 
Cynd,
 Adda took another worried glance at their star. She wondered if it was her imagination
only that played tricks with her eyes.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Mr 
 Godnor
  turned to watch the trembling needles of the various meters and gauges on the
chest of his lifelong companion. He had to force himself not to go and take 
 Sayn’s
  hand, or give him a peck on the cheek, as he knew complete rest would do the
best for him. But he couldn’t make himself leave the room, either. Instead, his
gaze spent what seemed hours on 
 the furrowed forehead now wet with oily perspiration, and the classic line of
the royal nose,
  which, among other things, had stolen his heart so long ago.</p>

<p class="pnorm">His heart sank as his tables drawn on parchments of the size of carpets and which
he’d filled with tiny numbers during hours and hours spent in front of the telescope
forced themselves into his mind again. It seemed that misfortunes never came
alone, and he wasn’t sure whether the King’s illness meant anything to the universe
on the brink of changes he couldn’t even dare to estimate. His numbers, which
used to align so neatly, now fell out of order; and he’d only found one vague
sentence in the few surviving codices written by the previous Versions that might
refer to such a phenomenon. ‘Legend has it that when the sun starts to move in
the outer sphere, the end of the world as we know it is nigh.’ And the sun had
started to move.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Although the 
 Friers
  were more and more at home at the Court and wielded more and more influence
over all branches of the state, they—according to some, fortunately—seemed
either unwilling to or downright incapable of understanding what they were actually
dealing with. They saw red rags all over the china shop, and they effectively
became a grotesque caricature of the hitherto respectable office of the court
jester. That said, what made them a hundred times harder to ignore than the royal
fool was that what they did was for real; and the 
 King,
  unable to grasp the seriousness of the situation through a fever of bad sectors
and corrupted files, kept repeating that there was nothing to be done, and that
nothing they did was, strictly speaking, against the law.</p>

<p class="pnorm">First, the Friers wanted everyone duly punished who took part in the cop shop
riot, so they had all 900 protesters arrested and charged with botslaughter.
But the courts threw their case out reasoning that if someone became a murderer
merely by breaking a coffee machine or dropping a phone on the pavement, then
everyone should be electrocuted. And if some robots decided to masquerade themselves
as such devices, well, then that amounted to endangering their own lives. In
other words, they asked for it.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Deprived of the chance to lock everyone up who disagreed with them in one go,
the Friers went on to dig up all the dirt they could on the out or closeted Washers
at the Court; and when there weren’t any circuits in the cupboard, they simply
made some up. With white-gloved hands, they courteously showed the empty dove
pan around, but it took a mere tap with the magic wand to fill it with unpaid
taxes, wrongly claimed expenses, embarrassing personal details, and a white dove
that was all too willing to testify to the amorous advances it had to suffer
by the person in question. Everyone knew they did it with smoke and reflecting
surfaces, but it was very effective.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They had 
 Jot Nifli,
  the Lord Steward of the King locked up after a tabloid took a shapely assistant
with curves that would’ve been enough for three, levitated her for a week, and,
with a grandiose theatrical gesture, turned her into a report about a particularly
ugly case of domestic violence. And the Friers excelled at vanishing tricks,
too. In the cases where conjuring false accusations didn’t help, members of the
Court simply started to disappear—and no one dared to report it in the media
lest they should also fall victim to the same trick of the state magician.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The 
 Chancellor
  also found himself at the wrong end of the magic wand. When he was served papers
at his residence kindly asking him to appear in front of a committee to answer
accusations that he’d thrown paper planes at a judge, Mikke knew he was not to
return from the hearing. He handed the keys to the residence and the butler to
 Elb and Nida,
  and was giving instructions to the gardener when the police surrounded the house,
and a SWAT team forced in the back door.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Cynd,
  I wish you all happiness with your chosen one!’ Mikke shouted to the trembling
boy as he was dragged outside and 
 Mrs Beetemle
  ran upstairs to get his
  toothbrush.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘From the bottom of my heart, I wish you all happiness with her!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">And then, he was gone.</p>



<a name="b1c7"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book1.gif" class="img1"/></p><h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">‘There’s only one thing worse than a civil war, and that’s an ill-mannered one.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">This is what the robots would say when someone—sitting over a coffee on a sunny
terrace, or standing on a street corner—leaned close to a friend, and asked,
in a low voice, if they knew anything about so-and-so who’d also gone missing.
What they didn’t know was that this ill-mannered civil war was pretty close to
an end.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The final clash in this gastronomically divided kingdom came not long after the
Royal Court had been declared a Washer-free area. The Friers, confident in their
success, decided that all that was needed was a finishing stroke to complete
their picture of a new, a Frier kingdom, and set out to destroy the origin of
the only power that opposed them, the house of Cynd’s family. The Washers only
knew about this because 
 Thom,
  in his desperation, had gone to the headquarters of Monopoil to ask his father
for some financial help, but left without even meeting him after he’d overheard
a conversation. Thom then told 
 Dul,
  who told his father, 
 Aved,
  who decided to take the lead once again, and sent all his remaining messenger
bots to everyone he could reach. One bot happened to trot into the Beetemle residence,
and 
 Mrs Beetemle, Braxon, Mumha, Nida, Elb
  and 
 Cynd
  decided to have tea to discuss what they should do.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They were not immediately in favour of violence, but by the time they’d decided
that it would be akin to admitting defeat to let the Friers demolish the house,
an army of Washers, young and old, women and men, those who had ‘royal’ tendencies
and those who constituted the majority, had already gathered, determined to defend
the family’s house.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘This is it,’ Elb said. ‘All we have left to fight for is ourselves.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Burning with zeal, he, Cynd and Braxon joined the fighters, and, somewhat reluctantly,
Nida and Mrs Beetemle followed them.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The two families led the two troops as they marched along 
 Cable Street,
  one from each end. The sun was shining brightly, and the metal bodies glimmered
like tiny waves on a puddle that wanted to be a sea. The city lied yonder, deserted;
only two pairs of eyes peeked out of the windows of the Royal Palace, anxiously
waiting for the first reports from the Royal Secret Service.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The Friers were somewhat surprised when they first saw the other group approaching,
but they didn’t really mind. They all knew that Kantro’s son, 
 Milo,
  had rigged the house with explosives, and beating the daylight out of the Washers
at the same time as sending their most important place up in a fireball was an
opportunity none of them wanted to miss. The two troops met exactly where the
house stood, and they stopped. There was, in large whitewashed letters, written
on the road:</p>

<p class="pnorm"><i>Ils ne passeront pas</i></p>

<p class="pnorm">Now this was really fascinating, because the inhabitants of this gloomy planet
didn’t speak French any better than English, and they didn’t speak English at
all. 
 Ricco
  and 
 Elb
  scratched their heads, trying to figure out which side the writing referred
to. 
 Mumha
  surveyed 
 Pattero
  with speculative eyes. She hadn’t stood that close to him since he’d almost
hit her with a cathode ray tube when they parted company.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well,’ Pattero said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We meet again.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Pattero opened his mouth to reply, but his voice was drowned out by the booming
chant of the Friers, who’d grown tired of their leaders trying to puzzle out
a miraculous message that might’ve brought eternal peace and happiness to the
universe and beyond. Mocking the well-known inability of the opinions and bodies
of elder citizens to hold water, they bawled:</p><p class="vsmallskip">
Mumha is a hundred now, senile senile-oh!<br/>
And she forgets she’s got a leak, senile senile-oh!<br/>
When she took a dip, and began to drip<br/>
On her thighs, on the rice; looking down she cried, “Oh!<br/>
That must be the way to cook!” Senile senile-oh!
</p><p class="psmallskip">The Washers answered by pelting the Friers with the arsenal they’d brought with
themselves. Stones, bricks, pieces of wood showered down on the enemy, who picked
them up, and threw them back, together with a couple of Molotov bombs, which
caused great alarm in the ranks of the Washers. They’d also made Molotovs, but
they’d filled the bottles with water instead of oil, and they soon discovered
that these weren’t of much use in the fight as the Friers declined to rust as
quickly as they hoped they would.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But what 
 Cynd
  brought turned out to be particularly effective. He sacrificed his collection
of marbles, and hurled them straight at 
 Pattero
  and Ricco, who, after sawing the air with their arms for a second, landed on
the ground with a loud clank. 
 Mrs Beetemle
  laughed, and 
 Nida
  laughed, and 
 Mumha
  grinned, but Adda, who was standing nearby, started shouting with flushed cheeks,
and, lifting her fist, craned her neck in search for Cynd in the commotion.</p>

<p class="pnorm">If recycling the projectiles had been complete, this could’ve been the arch-example
of all perpetual wars. Instead, on the five-yard-long section of the street that
separated the Washers and the Friers, the planks, stones and splinters slowly
accumulated and built up a barricade that no one really wanted to try to wade
through. And as the robots were running out of things to throw, the first wave
of attack gradually eased. There were many dents on their plates, and many heads
had to be readjusted, but neither side sustained serous injuries.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Until, out of nowhere, a severed arm appeared, lonely zooming through the air
over the barricade. It hit poor 
 Thom
  on the head, and brought him down in an instant. He didn’t have much left on
his body to protect him, and his circuits broke in the fall. The Friers, having
found something more effective to throw, were cheering the first Washer casualty.
The fight re-started with upper and lower extremities whizzing everywhere. Some
robots went as far as asking their fellows to detach their second arm as well,
and throw it at the enemy. They watched excitedly as it landed in their midst
to see if it hit anyone. (No one could see, but the arms kept their fingers crossed
as they flew.)</p>

<p class="pnorm">But those who gave their arms to their half-country were still better off than
those who made the unfortunate decision to give up their legs. Although legs
were heavier, and some even sent two robots to the ground at once, their former
owners suddenly found themselves unable to move and escape the small groups of
enemy soldiers who managed to break through the barricade now and then, and went
on a rampage before running back to safety among their own ranks. The 
 police,
  who finally made it to Cable Street, could hardly believe their eyes. Floundering
arms, hands, feet and legs peppered the battlefield, and their crippled owners
were hopping around as if engaged in a grotesque version of beach volleyball.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The police, sensing an obligation to restore order, first attempted to reunite
the limbs with their owners, then tried to stop all this nonsense altogether,
and used their batons to give weight to their words. The fighters’ attention
was now divided between the enemy and the police, and the Washers seemed to be
better at this kind of multitasking. They successfully beat off the police on
the left, and, step by step, were able to march forward and gain some ground
by picking up and hurling the debris from the barricade at the Friers. They were
now only about ten yards from the white letters on the asphalt, which had almost
completely disappeared.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mumha and Cynd,
  who’d been fighting in the first line all along, took advantage of the situation;
ran into their old house, and slammed the door in the face of 
 Ricco
 and 
Milo,
  who were after them, and secured the entrance from the inside.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The duo was so proud of their achievement, that they hardly noticed the sad state
the interior of their house was in. The walls were covered in binary graffiti;
the windows aborted due to a fatal system error, and oily spots all over the
floor marked the places where the local youth did that there. Mumha climbed,
as fast as her short legs could carry her, up to the top floor, and opened the
window that gave onto the street. The Washers cheered, and threw their badges
in the air when they saw her appearing with her arms outstretched, motioning
them to silence.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m not,’ she began, ‘a woman of words. But I have ears, and eyes, and a brain—don’t
think I don’t know how you feel. Don’t think I don’t know the question you’ve
asked yourself; I’ve asked it myself a thousand times. Were we where we are now,
if Pattero and I hadn’t ended our affair? Is the bloodshed and the sorry state
of this country his or my fault? You’ve never accused me, because you are too
kind; but the question hasn’t gone away. If misguided love has led us here, it
is your true love I need to put right what has gone wrong. Let me, therefore,
try to answer that question for you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd was standing at the living room window, watching the robots outside, when
he saw the Friers slowly drawing back. Nida or Elb couldn’t see them; the Washers
couldn’t see them, and grandma was too busy delivering her speech, but the Friers,
looking straight at the house, took one step back after the other. Without trying
to guess why, he punched the glass, and shouted ‘Run! Run!’ through the rain
of splinters.</p>

<p class="pnorm">In a moment, the house was flooded with specially treated oil, and the ensuing
explosion shot him out of the window.</p>

<p class="pnorm">When the fireball and the smoke dispersed, no one expected anything to have remained
of the house. But it was still there; the metal walls were melted, scorched and
twisted; the roof was gone, the ceiling had fallen in, and the bay windows of
the living room dangled lifelessly from the chimney of the house next door. A
police sergeant ran into the front garden.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How many were in there?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Two!’ Nida cried, desperately trying to inch her way through the crowd. ‘Two!
There were two!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Aved and five policemen rushed to the scene, walking carefully on freshly hardened
iron and smoking puddles of oil.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m here!’ shouted a sharp voice from the other side of the street. Everyone
looked there. It was Cynd; he’d landed on a heap of biodegradable garbage that
broke his fall, and he didn’t seem to have as much as a scratch on his body.
The only problem was that the heap was some way behind the front line, and a
couple of Friers had already closed round him. He jumped up, and darted toward
the Washers. He wasn’t as quick as usual, but still almost managed to reach the
barricade when Ricco grabbed at his arm. Cynd looked into his deep-set ghost-like
eyes, then at Adda, who was standing next to him, but did not stop for a second.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You almost killed me!’ he shouted in her face. ‘You want me dumped!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">When Nida saw where he was to cross the barricade, she leapt forward, and threw
the planks and stones aside to clear a tiny path. With Elb, they’d gotten halfway
through when Cynd ran into their arms. They grabbed him, swung him round, and
thrust him back among the Washers, out of the danger zone.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mumha
  was found under a bush. Under two bushes, to be exact, in the opposite corners
of the little garden. It was immediately apparent that she was beyond repair.
Her torso was torn into two; the wires had melted and the circuits had cracked
in the heat. The quicksilver that stored her thoughts and memories had probably
boiled away in an instant. Her skull had been deformed and gutted by the fire,
leaving a few curled wires for a brain, and three scorched holes for a face.
She was declared dead on the scene.</p>

<p class="pnorm">When three 
 policemen
  came out of the garden, holding the pieces of Mumha in their hands, the Washers
finally woke up from their petrified fright. They turned to fall upon the Friers,
but the police were quicker. The officers formed a living fence on the remains
of the barricade that the explosion hadn’t blown away, keeping the two groups
in check with as many sparker guns.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Stay where you are, ladies and gentlemen,’ said the sergeant from the megaphone
built into his stomach. ‘We don’t want any more casualties here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why not?’ shouted 
 Pattero,
  but he didn’t move. ‘Take one or leave one, it won’t make much difference with
these.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You loved this woman, relaybrain!’ howled 
 Aved.
  ‘You have no decency left?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Look guys, a talking fridge! “Yah hay nay dacinsee leepht?”’ a Frier mocked
Aved. ‘Just wait there, you version nought geezer, you won’t have no decency
when I push your face in, either.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Elb slowly turned away from the police line. His cover turned cold, and Nida
put her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Aved didn’t let it rest. ‘That’s all you pyromaniacs can do. Kill, kill, kill!
The world would be a better place without the likes of you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, we happen to think the opposite, pissforbrains,’ Milo joined in. ‘You
should’ve burnt in that house, all of you!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He leapt forward to grab at Aved. The policeman who stood there started back,
afraid that his sparker might accidentally kill Milo, and he dragged his neighbours
with him.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Another Frier jumped forward. Now the whole police line moved. The Washers standing
at the front retreated a couple of careful steps to avoid the lethal weapons
sticking out of the other side of the line like pins from a power plug.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Burn!’ Ricco howled, as all Friers standing at the front stepped forward, forcing
the police and the Washers to retreat even further.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Stop! Stop right there!’ the sergeant’s voice boomed through the loudspeaker,
but it had no effect.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Burn! Burn! Burn!’ the Friers chanted, and moved forward. The sergeant hardly
audibly ordered the force to put the sparkers away. For a short minute, they
tried to hold the Friers back, but they were pushed forward like a piece of toilet
paper stuck to the gun of a tank.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Burn! Burn! Burn!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The Washers had turned around and were now in full retreat, some walking, some
already running to avoid the Friers who jumped forward and tried to snatch away
the slower ones at the back.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They hadn’t reached the end of Cable Street when the policemen had already been
jostled out of the way; it dawned on the Washers that they were now running for
their lives, and the chase began. Among the pounding feet Ricco dashed forward
and narrowly missed Cynd, who couldn’t keep up with the rest. Elb, seeing this,
got behind his son to protect him, and Nida grabbed his hand, pulled him forward,
and ran with all her might to reach safety somewhere, somewhere.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco fell behind Milo and Feina. Adda was also there, running, her cheeks all
oily but expressionless, with her motionless eyes focused on one square head
ahead.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Elb somehow missed a step. He dropped flat on the ground. Nida screamed, bowed
down to catch his hand, but he was already gone under a roaring sea of legs,
trampled upon, silenced, and flattened into non-existence.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd stopped.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida stopped.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was a decision made in an instant, and regretted for eternity.</p>

<p class="pnorm">She let her legs carry her forward again, and dragged Cynd with herself.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘There’s nothing we can do,’ she said, squeezing the grown-up hand so hard that
it hurt.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd glanced back. He found Adda’s determined eyes and flushed cheeks loathsome
and pitiful. He imagined splitting her into two with his eyes, and, to Adda,
it was exactly how it felt. Then he turned his head forward, and never looked
back again.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">The Washers didn’t stop. When they got out of the Frier ghetto, and Pattero’s
mob got too tired to chase them any further, they went straight home, packed
the essentials, the spare batteries, their troughs, and got in their cars. They
left King Sayn and Mr Godnor, they left the kingdom, but most importantly, they
left the Friers behind. They drove to the end of the roads, and then continued
to drive; and when the dust clogged up the engines, they continued to walk, and
they didn’t stop until they reached the other side of the planet, the undiscovered
country from whose bounds so few had returned.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They didn’t know what they were going to do. All they knew was they had no place
under the sun.</p>



<a name="b2c1"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book2.gif" class="img2"/></p><h1>Book 2<br/>Chapter 1</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Layers and layers of soft dust had already settled on the prefabricated metal
buildings erected on the dark hemisphere of Glaucon
  when the news came that the Friers had dropped a couple of prisoners at the
border between the old and the new country, in the Transition Zone. 
 The Washers’ buildings, made of corrugated metal sheets, resembled oversized
tin boxes and empty oil barrels huddled together in an impact crater. They were
rusty and bare—in the constant blackness there was no need for decorations—,
and their location was specifically chosen by the Washers, who’d hoped that the
rim of mountains would protect them from the unknown.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The Washers sent a squad to fetch the prisoners, and, as they hadn’t been readjusted
to the darkness yet, escorted them back to the 
capital.
 It was there, at the ceremony
 organised to mark their arrival, that 
 Cynd and Nida
  saw them for the first time. There were four of them:
  Mikke Beetemle, tin and bones,
 Jot Nifli, the ex-Lord Steward of Sayn,
and two others Cynd vaguely remembered seeing
back at the Court. 
 Those four years they’d spent in the dungeon had left their mark on them: they
were haggard, weak and broken, and fidgeted uncomfortably on the makeshift stage
like blind boring machines stranded overground.
  But soon, it was announced, the People’s Smith would start their treatment,
and they would begin to grow like everyone else.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd chuckled when the newcomers were given a temporary pair of glasses with
built-in miniaturised suns to make them able to see in the dark, and they didn’t
know whether to stare at the sky, filled with more stars, interstellar clouds,
gleaming cheellags and deep purple tayuhts than they’d ever seen before; or to
gasp in amazement at how their fellow Washers looked. 
Aved,
 for example, who officially welcomed the prisoners as one of the two members
of the new High Council, 
 had grown yet another inch in all three directions since last week thanks, in part, to
Cynd’s efforts, and now had to support his riveted body with an over-extended
right arm that functioned as a third leg. With a waist that was left at its original
size, and was way too narrow, he looked like some fragile hourglass, richly gilded
on the edges and the corners.
 He
 readily explained to the prisoners that the Washer race intended to become indestructible
by increasing their size and physical strength. Not that they had ever succumbed,
oh no; well, except to odds.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The next one to speak was 
Mikke
 himself, who was joined on stage by his 
wife.
 His brassy voice hadn’t regained its strength, and the microphone was shaking in his hand,
 but he talked at length about his pride to be a Washer, and about his amazement
at how quickly they had built a new country. He thanked everyone for supporting
the members of the High Council, and the Council itself for their hard work,
especially that of his wife,
 Mrs, that is, <i>Councillor</i> 
Beetemle, who was 
smiling rather officially and Councillor-like in navy blue enamel coating completed
by a platinum bearing ball necklace around her delicate neck that had begun to
wrinkle with use.
  It wasn’t entirely clear why the Friers had let them go, Mikke continued. All
Mr Checka, the Frier head of the Secret Service, told them was that they couldn’t
hate the Washers enough while they were still there, and the next thing they
knew, they were as free as four interstellar spaceships.</p>

<p class="pnorm">After Mikke’s speech had ended, the four ex-prisoners mingled with the crowd.
They were greeted with hugs, joyful handshakes, and pats on the back, while the rest
of the crowd cheered and applauded for good half an hour. Hardly noticeably,
Mikke manoeuvred his wife around so that they’d meet 
Cynd and Nida.
 Cynd could hardly look Mikke in the eye without being blinded by the two miniature
suns. But that didn’t stop the ex-Chancellor from giving Cynd a long, warm hug, and, when no
one was looking, surreptitiously slipping a messenger into the boy’s pocket.
Cynd wasn’t sure if it was because Aved saw this, or because he simply had enough
of the newcomers stealing the show, but four guards were sent to escort the ex-prisoners
back to the stage. Then, Aved made a brief announcement that the newcomers were
tired and needed rest, and, without further ado, put an end to the celebration.</p>

<p class="pnorm">While 
Nida and her son
 were walking home on the dust-covered streets, 
Cynd
 managed to connect to the messenger without removing it from his pocket. It
was from Adda. His first reaction was to abort the transmission. But then curiosity
got the better of him, and he continued to listen. Somehow the messenger felt
smaller than they used to, and the connection was a bit flaky, but the recording
came through surprisingly clearly. A certain warmth crept over him as he heard
the familiar voice—reminiscent of all the memories they had left behind.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda started by saying that she was sorry, and that she hoped Cynd was all right.
Apparently, she’d got into trouble for pulling Ricco back when he almost caught
Cynd on Cable Street.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Little blue sparks started to trickle down Cynd’s cheeks.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What’s the matter?’ 
Nida
 asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Dad was given a clean burial. Nothing was missing from him.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida was silent for a moment.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Adda?’ she asked, hardly audibly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd nodded.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida took his grown hand, and they walked on without saying a word.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Cynd
 ran to lift the door when 
Mikke’s
 knock so familiar from the time in his residence on the Filehall sounded on
the outer wall. 
 The house
Nida
 and 
Cynd
 now lived in was in the 
second region
of the new capital, and wasn’t exactly a palace. It was one of the many oil barrel-shaped
buildings the Washers hastily put up in a district intended to evoke the feelings
associated with a suburb, but which, consisting of a grid of rusty barrels on
a field of boggy dust, failed miserably to do that.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Nice place!’ Mikke said when he stepped in, but Cynd thought he was simply being
polite. 
 Their barrel was partitioned into two bedrooms and a living room, with hardly
any furnishings above the barest necessities. The most prominent—and most modern—features
of the bedrooms were the outlets Nida and Cynd used to charge themselves, while
the living room boasted a small table and a sofa hammered into shape from some
tubing, conveniently placed to hide a hole where the metal wall had rusted through.
   Cynd noticed that Mikke’s eyes had been replaced with a pair of V3s—Cynd himself
only had V24s, because they didn’t have enough money to upgrade—, and they
had already started making Mikke taller by bolting three two-and-half plates
on his soles.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s not very comfortable to walk on these,’ Mikke admitted, ‘but they said
the husband of a Councillor shouldn’t stay as small as before the War.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t really see why it’s necessary,’ Nida said, placing a condenser on the
table, and offering a seat to their guest. ‘Look at what I’ve had to do to Cynd.
He’s almost half as big again as his original size. I tried to keep him in proportion,
though. Except for the extra thick legs to support the weight. And the standard
is raised every other week. We can hardly keep up.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What do they do if you refuse?’ Mikke asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They’re a bit lenient when it comes to existing robots. But if you decide to
build a child—they won’t get off your back. It must be huge, or they won’t
socialise it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Interesting,’ Mikke said. There was no surprise in his voice. ‘Do they really
think being big will protect us?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Apparently,’ Cynd said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘This is just compensation gone too far,’ Mikke declared.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, I’m sure you haven’t seen it all yet,’ Nida said in resignation. ‘Perhaps
it’s best for the new generation. They won’t have to live in shame like we do.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’re not even allowed to mention dad any more!’ Cynd burst out.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, I did want to express my sympathy,’ Mikke said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you,’ smiled Nida. ‘He was a great man.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘He was,’ Mikke nodded, taking Nida’s hand. Then, he turned to Cynd. ‘Have you,’
he asked, ‘listened to the message?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd looked at him warily. ‘What message?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh I’m sorry, Cynd,’ Mikke went on, ‘but seeing what’s going on here I think
it’s best if your mother also knows about it.’ Turning to Nida, he explained
how Adda had sent a messenger to the prison that he had duly delivered to Cynd,
and gave it to him the first time they met. ‘So,’ he insisted, ‘have you opened
it yet?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why, didn’t you open it yourself?’ Cynd asked back with his blazing eyes fixed
on the ex-chancellor.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Of course not! Look, I don’t want to pry into your affairs. But I’d be more
than grateful if you could tell us the tone of her message and anything you think
you can tell us. After all,’ he added, ‘I risked a lot by bringing it here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, yes,’ Cynd hesitated. ‘Thanks very much for that. She… she says she
tried to help in the battle but couldn’t, and that she’s sorry. She also did
everything to bury dad. That’s all. I don’t really have anything to hide that’s
related to that girl.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Do you believe her?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd paused. ‘I really don’t know. I think she might’ve made this up to apologise.
But then I’m not sure why she would’ve done that.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I think your relationship with Adda could become pretty important. When the
time is right, you might consider sending a reply. But you’ll have to be careful—that
message might not be what it seems.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How do you mean?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m not sure myself. But it’s not what I’d’ve sent in her place.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">The slightly larger barrels that contained governmental offices, the Memory House,
and the Council Hall itself were in the middle of the primary region of the city,
organised around a square that, perhaps a bit pretentiously, had been named the
Forum.
  Cynd passed it every time he made his way to the only educational institution
of the new country, the 
Academy,
 which was founded by Aved in the hope of training as loyal, fierce and, last
but not least, as big soldiers as possible.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Life at the Academy was usually not bad, but, as Cynd observed, they didn’t seem
to learn much there. They spent most of their time marching up and down outside
in the court learning drill commands, forming ranks, squares, triangles, and,
sometimes, circles. Most of the remaining time was spent doing the same in the
 dimly lit hallways, whose curved corrugated sheet ceilings echoed the architecture
of Roman palaces. It was sheer coincidence, of course, as the robots knew nothing
about Rome, the Italian Peninsula, or the Earth, but the Universe had a habit
of creating such coincidences to pass the time.</p>

<p class="pnorm">When they weren’t drilling, they usually had to listen to readings of Aved’s
latest speeches, of which, since he’d built a grammalerator for himself, there’d
been more than enough. All in all, if it hadn’t been for the fact that all of
 Cynd’s
  Washer friends, including 
 Dul
  and 
 Braxon,
  were there, and that Cynd enjoyed a somewhat special status among the students,
the Academy would’ve been as boring as a depleted p-n region. But it was compulsory
to attend for everyone after Version Four-One until they became at least sixteen
feet tall, or a quarter of a ton (whichever came first), so there was nothing
to be done.</p>

<p class="pnorm">However, since the newcomers had arrived, the atmosphere at the Academy had tensed.
There were rumours that 
 Mikke
  and 
 Jot
  were touring the country, delivering speeches—sometimes inside the barrels
which served as 
 town halls, sometimes
  on top of them—about their expertise and achievements in governmental affairs.
They were said to have been dropping numerous, not too subtle hints that they
were in a much better position to govern than Aved.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We appreciate that Councillor Hhan has created a new country instead of the
old we had. But is it what we really wanted?’ stormed Mikke 
 in one of the suburban barrels around the capital,
  comfortably leaving Mrs Beetemle out of the picture.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What old country?’ someone shouted from the audience, near where 
 Cynd
  was standing. ‘This is our country.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mikke blinked once, then twice. Then, not being able to analyse the question
as a meaningful query about the state of the world as he knew it, he went on.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We couldn’t have forgotten the toils and efforts that lied ahead immediately
after the War. But now, the time has come to&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Death to the Friers, long live the Washers!’ chanted the crowd a number of times
when they heard the word ‘War.’ Then, they burst out in an ovation and applause
complemented by some stomping and hugging the robots standing next to themselves.
Mikke turned to Jot.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why are they cheering?’ he asked. Jot blinked twice as well, and then shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p class="pnorm">In the end, they managed to overcome the difficulties in communicating to the
citizens of the new country, who were eager to hear what Mikke and Jot had to
say about restoring the golden age, about a wonderful thing called the welfare
state where everyone had enough electricity, and about something they had read
about in alien codices and thought about in prison, <i>democracy,</i> which
sounded very exotic and nice.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So, what’s this farewell state you’re talking about?’ an old robot asked Mikke
 during the Q and A session that followed.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mikke didn’t have the heart to correct the only one who asked a question.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s a state where no one lives in want.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But we’ve got everything here. We’ve all got electricity and the like.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh yes,’ 
 Mikke
  agreed. ‘The ones that can still rub each other to charge up are fine. The ones
who haven’t yet started to shut down, they do get a little from the state to
carry on. And the rest… well, a little electricity won’t help them a bit,
so we simply don’t bother.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And democracy?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well,’ explained Jot, ‘democracy is where everyone’s got a say in how the country
is run.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You really mean everyone?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes,’ Jot said, standing straight.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Even the Friers?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Laughter rippled through the meeting room.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, not exactly,’ Mikke tried to intervene, but his argument wasn’t to be
heard.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And the babies?’ someone asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And the thickos?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And my neighbour?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The laughter grew.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And the strangers?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And the dead?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And you?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd,
  standing around the middle, felt cold voltage creeping up his spine as the audience
roared with laughter. </p>

<p class="pnorm">The old man leaned closer to the stage. ‘Look, my sons,’ he said, ‘I’m sure it’s
a swell idea. But you haven’t really thought it through, have you?’</p>



<a name="b2c2"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book2.gif" class="img2"/></p><h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Cynd
  saw that something was wrong when he met 
 Braxon
  the next time in 
 the dilapidated, rusty cottage behind the Academy. It used to belong to the caretaker
until, about a year ago, he was found on the floor, discharged. He’d probably
drunk so much that he’d forgotten to attach himself to the connector before going
to standby. Now there was a rust-eaten hole in the roof, and no one cared to
level the dusty ground inside.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m so glad I’ve got you,’ Braxon said, hardly above a whisper.
 His large eyes were eagerly searching Cynd’s face.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd let him take his hand. The gawky, rebellious early teenage years seemed
to have passed, and, lately, their friendship had deepened and taken an unexpected
turn. Cynd didn’t really mind—it was refreshing to be connected to someone
more reliable and down-to-earth after Adda’s constant dreamy monologues.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They were already in each other’s arms when 
 Dul
  stepped into the hut.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Ahem,’ he said, and the two quickly separated. Braxon still looked moody, but
Cynd couldn’t help turning red.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘This isn’t what it looks like,’ he said quickly, which didn’t really make Braxon
more cheerful.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Whatever,’ Dul said with a wave of his short arm, and turned to Braxon.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So,’ he asked, ‘why the long face, mate?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Braxon looked down.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Folks,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I mean,’ he went on, ‘I’m glad that dad is back, but with my mother in the Council,
they can’t talk about anything but politics. They spend hours on end arguing.
Dad even threatened to move out.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Mikke?’ asked Cynd back in surprise. ‘Moving out?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And what happened?’ Dul asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Obviously, mum couldn’t let that happen. It would’ve ruined her image.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What were they arguing about, anyway?’ Dul asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, you know how dad read all this funky stuff in prison. I want to have a proper
democracy, he says; and about everyone living better or something.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What’s the problem with everyone living a bit better?’ Cynd asked warily.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, nothing really,’ Braxon explained, ‘but mother says we can’t afford it.
There aren’t enough resources. Otherwise, she says, they would’ve already done
everything dad wants.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was a moment of silence that signalled either weary resignation or tacit
disagreement.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘If, basically, they agree,’ Dul noted, ‘why are they arguing?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t know!’ Braxon’s voice rose. ‘I don’t give a fuck about taxes and the
treasury, and I don’t feel like going home at all, but someone should try to
calm them down before something happens.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I wouldn’t fret too much about it,’ Dul said. ‘Nothing’s gonna stay the way
it is anyway.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Braxon looked at him.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And what’s that supposed to mean?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Dul shrugged his shoulders, and left.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd tried to soothe Braxon as they were lying next to each other, but, after
half an hour of idle talk, Braxon thought he’d better go home, so they got up,
took their stuff, levelled the ground to make it look as if no one had been in
there, and went their separate ways.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Cynd
  went home, had some rest, and then, because of a change in the schedule, found
himself in the main 
 auditorium of the Academy
  listening to yet another speech by 
 Aved,
  this time delivered by the man himself.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Fellow Washers!’ Aved began, and then cleared his throat, waiting for the speech
to load from his memory. ‘It wasn’t too long ago that our very existence was
under threat. We had to fight to keep faithful to our persuasion; we had to fight
to keep our children safe; we had to fight to survive. But we persevered, and
achieved all that you see around yourselves. But once more&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Applause from the students interrupted the speech. Cynd took the opportunity
to take a look around: 
 Dul
  was sitting in the first row, but Braxon was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But once more,’ Aved continued, ‘we are under threat. This time, however, the
danger is not coming from the outside. Many individuals, as well as our society
as a whole, are struggling under the weight of deceitful, false promises, and
mistaken convictions. Everyone, and every transistor in every robot, has a decision
to make. Either you are with us, or you are with <i>them.</i> But make no mistake:
we, with those who choose to follow us, will not yield, will not rest until our
country is cleansed of all falsity and perfidy. We are not afraid.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We will come together, and realising we’ve been on the correct path all along,
will go forward stronger than ever. We will come together, and realising the
flaws of certain convictions, will shake them off and see our path clearer than
ever. Those are the convictions you need to be afraid of, and of those who voice
them to sow the seeds of discontent. We are not afraid.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Aved stopped for a minute, scrolling the speech back and forth in his head.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We are not afraid… Although we’re afraid of the convictions, we’re not
frightened… True Washers are never afraid to follow their convictions…
and persevere… until there’s nothing to be afraid.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd’s head heated up as his language input module tried to keep up with Aved’s
logic.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We must be determined to confront the evil and the very worst of robot nature.
May Infinite Ingwyne and his follower, Mumha, continue to protect us and deliver us
from the Evil of Sinmara.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The students had trouble feigning enthusiasm when they started clapping. Cynd
automatically raised his hands, too, but his whole brain was occupied with the
task of figuring out what Aved had meant with this sloppy harangue.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">After some time spent in the 
 quadrangle
  lining up in the shape of all the seventeen regular polygons known to robotkind,
 Cynd,
  as he did every week, visited 
 Aved
  in his 
 office.
  The reason for these visits was that Aved had fallen victim to the very obsession
he’d devised to keep the Washers occupied. As they were required to grow larger
and larger, Aved had to keep a step ahead of them to continue to command respect
by his mere mass. He soon realised that Cynd, if not a full-fledged engineer
yet, was already an able mechanic, and that he could easily get the boy to help
him grow, which otherwise depended on the service provided by the People’s Smith—rationed,
of course, to ensure equal (and equally bad) access for all.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Moreover, as Cynd was a student at the Academy, it was all too easy for Aved
to ensure that he won’t shoot his mouth off.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, hi, Cynd; how are we, how are we?’ Aved said affably when he let him in.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Not bad, thanks,’ said Cynd, and he put his bag down in the corner. 
 The office was made of the same cheap sheets as the whole Academy, and the floor
echoed their every step. There was a glass window installed just above Aved’s
ceramic desk—a remnant of the architecture from the old country, where there
was light outside. Aved had occupied this office ever since the Academy was ceremoniously
opened, but he still hadn’t found the time to unpack his speeches, and so boxes
full of punch cards and magnetic tapes littered the floor.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’re late.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m sorry,’ Cynd said sulkily, ‘we had problems with the seventeenth polygon.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh did you? Well, never mind. I just wanted to start ASAP because I thought
we might be occupied for some time. Well, I guess I don’t need to explain. I
need fixing.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He stood up, and it became apparent what he meant. 
 His head and torso had been enlarged again by about an inch in every direction.
Compared to his upper body, his legs looked weak and scrawny, with feet so big
that he walked as if he’d been wearing platform shoes made of concrete. The contrast
wasn’t so evident when he stood behind the lectern, but now he had to grab the
table to keep his balance.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I suggest we start with the thighs. And I don’t think we’ll be able to get away
with it without reinforcing the hip joints as well.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd gulped. The hip joints were famously the most sensitive mechanical parts
of any robot, and he’d had no experience with them at all.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, I’m not entirely sure I can&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Of course you can. It’s Commemoration soon; I don’t have any more ration stamps,
and I simply can’t get around the city like this. And I look laughable to boot.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Could I take a closer look before we proceed?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Sure. Take your time,’ said Aved, 
 sliding a latch and lifting a part of the metal sheet wall of the office to reveal
a secret partition with an iron operating table, cables, pliers, cans of water
and oil, welding torches, a rusty old grinder, and quite a few spare metal plates
and rivets.
  With difficulty, he got on top of the table and lay down; and Cynd, mostly in
order to screw up his courage, examined the latest extensions to Aved’s body
in detail.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The People’s Smith had done a pretty lousy job. The head plates were coming apart,
exposing the integrated and the multicultural circuits. The head itself wasn’t
screwed on right, forcing it to connect wirelessly to the rest of the body. The
chest was in no better shape, either. The plates were wrongly cut, and the burrs
hadn’t been removed from the edges, giving it the look of a marginalised subculture.
The belly part was simply bent inward to loosely connect to the original hip—a
temporary solution, to be sure, but it’d make the job all the more difficult
for Cynd.</p>

<p class="pnorm">With a sigh, he turned to get the large hex key to start loosening the covers
of the hip joint, when there was an impatient tap on the door.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Quick, quick,’ whispered 
 Aved,
  jumping off the table and pushing 
 Cynd
  to the 
 middle of his office.
  Then he strode to the door, and without looking back, used his overlong arm
to pull the metal sheet back in front of the partition.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes? Who is it?’ he asked, and without waiting for an answer, opened the door.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was 
 Braxon.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hi, young man,’ Aved greeted the skinny robot, a little more loudly than necessary.
‘What
are you doing here? You weren’t there to listen to my latest speech. Do you have
a medical certificate?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, I don’t,’ he flared, ‘you know perfectly well why I wasn’t here. My father
was taken away, I guess for questioning. Even mum hasn’t been able to reach him.
Tell me where he is, or I’ll tell everyone how you treat robots who suffered
a lot for being a Washer.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Mikke?’ asked Aved, without his face changing expression. ‘Oh that,’ he added
a second later; he stepped to his hive balanced at the edge of his desk, fished
out a messenger, connected to it briefly to give instructions, and tossed it
out of the window. It was only then that Braxon noticed Cynd in the office. They
exchanged glances before Aved turned back to Braxon.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It is,’ Aved broke the silence, ‘rather impertinent of you to come here and
question me. But,’ he raised his hand to silence Braxon, ‘I understand your fear
of losing your father for a second time. Although Mikke asked me not to let anyone
know, I can tell you that nothing you accuse me of has happened. He was given
a special treatment by the People’s Smith, and, in fact, it seems he got a much
better service than myself.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was a low grating noise caused by some tiny piece of metal scraping a 
 pane of glass. They all looked at the window.
  It was the messenger bot, trying to get in.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That was quick,’ Aved said, and let the messenger in. The tiny creature hopped
onto the table, climbed down a leg, and placed itself in the middle of the room.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Take it,’ Aved said to Braxon. ‘It’s for you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Hesitatingly, Braxon took the messenger in his hand, and connected to it. In
the silence they could all hear what it said. It was a very short message: ‘I’m
home. Everything’s fine,’ and was cryptosigned, ‘Mikke.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Braxon just stood there for a minute. Then, with shaking hands, he put the messenger
back on the table, and, without looking at Aved, said, ‘I’m sorry, headmaster.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s quite all right, Braxon. I remember the times when we had to face much
graver dangers together. You’re a brave and honest boy, and I think you’re going
to make it here at the Academy.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Braxon looked at him; this time with large, pleading eyes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Please don’t tell Mrs Beetemle that I was here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I won’t,’ Aved patted him on his shoulder.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Braxon caught a glimpse of Cynd, and left the office. The door closed down very
slowly and very quietly, as if it hoped no one would notice it doing so.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">‘Let’s get back to work,’ 
 Aved
  said, trying hard to don the benevolent countenance he’d worn before. He got
on the table in the 
 partition
  again, and started chatting as soon as 
 Cynd
  set about removing the covers from the hip joint.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You know, Cynd,’ he began, carefully choosing his words, ‘I really feel sorry
for Mr Beetemle. And I know you’re going out with Braxon, so I wouldn’t be surprised
if you felt disturbed by what he’s said.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd felt heat building up in his neck, but remained silent. Aved lifted his
head to glance at him, and continued.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Of course, what I’m about to tell you now is strictly confidential. Your mother
knows about this, so that’s OK, but it wouldn’t do any good if word got out.
So, top secret, okay?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Sure,’ Cynd replied as he removed the last plate. He found himself bending over
the joint, looking at it from much closer than necessary.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’re in a peculiar situation right now. The ideas of the newcomers are fine
and commendable, but, let me tell you, nothing new. We’ve been working to achieve
the exact same goals all along. The problem is with the way they advocate those
ideas. Ooh, careful!’ he winced as Cynd was trying to dislodge a cable that got
stuck under a shaft.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Sorry.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Never mind. So, as I said, it has cast doubt on their integrity. After long
discussions in the Council and with the police, and to our deep regret, we have
to regard them as suspects for espionage.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Suddenly Cynd realised the real meaning of what Aved was saying, and the burning
sensation crept from his neck to his pocket. It was there that he kept the physical
manifestation of his connection to Mikke and the Friers: the messenger from Adda.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I understand,’ he forced himself to say, while he imagined Mikke and himself
tied to chairs and threatened with forced login by the police.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It wasn’t my decision,’ Aved went on. ‘I only wanted to tell you so that you’d
know what we’re up against. Will you be OK with Braxon?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, it’ll be fine.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘He’s a very fine lad, no matter what his father is doing.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Thoughts were reeling in Cynd’s head. He couldn’t decide whether he should tell
Braxon about this. He could ask his mother, but she’d surely tell him to keep
his mouth shut. Were they themselves in danger? Did he tell too much to Mikke?
Did Mikke tell anything about the messenger to the police? He tried to make himself
focus on the joint, and relegate the thought processes to another processor he
rarely used. But they overloaded the old CPU, and kept disturbing the work of
the rest of his brain. Occasionally, this made his hand shake, and his temperature
periodically got out of control.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How are you getting on?’ Aved enquired.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I have the joint here,’ Cynd replied slowly, ‘I’m trying to see how it could
be best reinforced. We can… replace the socket with beryllium, or replace
the whole joint with one that’s about three times as large. I guess. Then, another
option might be to limit the movement, and thicken both the… the socket
and the ball from the outside.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m not sure if we’ve got enough beryllium. And it would be nice to keep it
flexible, if possible, so that leaves us with replacing the whole thing. Are
you sure I’d need such a large joint?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s what the calculations show. But I haven’t taken a look at the inside
yet. The wear and tear can give a better indication of the forces it would need
to take.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, let’s take a look, then.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are you sure?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, of course, just get on with it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Obediently, Cynd lodged a screwdriver between the two parts of the left joint,
and pried and pulled until the screwdriver started to bend. The old processor
in his head got overloaded again. He closed his eyes to force the thoughts to
the background, and kept pushing the screwdriver inward. Suddenly, the screwdriver
slid through the joint; he heard something cracking, and then the dying hum of
Aved shutting down.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He opened his eyes in terror to find the whole lower body separated with the
legs dangling lifelessly from the table. The arterial cables were torn in two,
which meant that there was nothing powering the upper body either. It’d take
about four minutes for the capacitors in Aved’s brain to discharge. If he managed
to restore the power supply before that, Aved wouldn’t notice a thing.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He searched for the right tools frantically to re-join the legs to the torso.
He found some clamps that he used two align the two parts while he installed
a carbon fibre net as a temporary reinforcement around the joints. He used the
wan flame of a differential welding torch to heat the sockets, and a square root
to cool the balls so that he could join them again. He almost melted one of his
fingers as the two operators started to steal the coefficients, but in the last
minute, the joints yielded to the power of mathematics and popped back into place.
Checking the time again and again, he separated the 32 wires of the arterial
cable on both ends, and carefully soldered them together, hiding the split under
a swathe of antiseptic insulating tape.</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was no time for the pre-power checks. Counting the remaining seconds, he
opened Aved’s mouth and used his left hand to hold his tongue in place while
he entered the codes on the mainboard to power the torso up. He felt the renewing
tension in the muscles. He carefully pulled his fingers out, wiped them, and
positioned the screwdriver above the hip. He tried to move to the same position
he’d been in when it all happened, and then, with a surreptitious hand, typed
in the last number sequence to power Aved’s brain up.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hm,’ Cynd said after a second.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was hard to describe his joy when he heard Aved’s bored voice.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What’s that?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I think I’ve got good news.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Really?’ said Aved, moving his arms to sit up.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, no, no!’ Cynd pushed him back onto the table. ‘You’ll break the open joint
if you move. And I wouldn’t look at it if I were you, anyway.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’ll do as the doctor says,’ smiled Aved. ‘So what’s the good news?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘There’s no excessive wear on the inside of the sockets, so it’ll be more than
enough to reinforce the hip joint from the outside.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He sincerely hoped he sounded confident enough. There was no way he was going
to open those joints again.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Aved smiled. ‘I’m in a better shape than we thought, eh?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Looks like it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Will you put my hip back together then?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Just a minute,’ Cynd said, grabbed the thighs firmly, pretended to push them
against the torso, and, when Aved couldn’t see, tapped lightly on the artery.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Ouch!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s done.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He then proceeded to install, as agreed, another carbon fibre net layer wrapping
the joints. On the one hand, Aved didn’t know that there was one there already,
and on the other, Cynd had doubts whether a single net would be strong enough
to safely support the upper body. He couldn’t do anything else but hope that
the two layers would be enough.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He then cut, bent and installed a new metal shell around the legs, taking care
to adorn it with extra rivets around the knee and the ankles. He managed to straighten
the bottom of the plates the People’s Smith added to the stomach, and welded
on it a dozen safety cables running between the torso and the legs, all hidden
from view.
 Then, he polished Aved’s whole surface until it shone in black, and
gilded all the rivets and the edges of the plates.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Aved was very impressed when Cynd unveiled the result and showed him, in a handheld
mirror, how he looked from behind. He jumped up to take a look in the full-length
mirror he’d fastened to the inside of the office door, but he swayed dangerously
as he took the first step. Cynd had to grab his back to support him.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Your legs will feel unfamiliar at the beginning,’ he said, stammering through
the words.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, oh yes. I’ll have to take it easy for a bit. Are you sure the joints are
all right?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd felt his temperature rising again. ‘Well, I took a look at the wear and
tear, and did the calculations&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, you did,’ Aved said, hardly paying attention. ‘Don’t worry, look at this!
I just work fine!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">And with that, he lifted his left leg, and then the right leg, and he crouched
down, and stood up, cracking his joints loudly. Then, he stood in front of the
large mirror, posing as if he was trying on a new paint.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Splendid,’ he said, ‘absolutely splendid. Great work, Cynd.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd could hardly make himself mumble good-bye before he lifted the door and
got out of the office as quickly as possible. Somehow he felt that if he wasn’t
in there, nothing bad would happen.</p>



<a name="b2c3"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book2.gif" class="img2"/></p><h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Just a couple of hours later, it was already time for the Commemoration, a weekly
event which, apart from the ceremony itself, involved lots of preparation. Everyone
had to adorn themselves with painted motifs that the Council classified as sufficiently
traditional, which made them look frighteningly like the flamboyant robots operating
in the blue-light district, who, for obvious reasons, were sometimes called ‘royal’
escorts.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Robots living in the capital had already gathered in the 
 Memory House,
  from where the ceremony was to be broadcast by a constant stream of messengers
to every corner of the new country. 
 This building was the only one in the country that wasn’t built from metal sheets.
Instead, it was made of billions of tiny magnetite cubes that absorbed every
photon that got near them, but each of which stored in their carefully etched
magnetic patterns hundreds of documents and records of the mostly imaginary history
of the Washer homeland.
  Nida
 and 
Cynd
  were there, covered in wet paint, as well as Mrs 
 Beetemle
 and 
Mikke—who
  indeed had grown a lot since Cynd had last seen him—all sitting in the immense
auditorium, waiting patiently for the ceremony to begin. The enormous door slowly
lifted behind them, and 
 Aved
  appeared, looking like a viceroy with his new golden rivets, and the sufficiently
traditional silver chains that were always attached to the waist of whoever officiated
at the ceremony, and which he dragged after himself on the concrete making a
terrible noise. A 
 select group of students
  from the Academy followed him along the central aisle carrying cases loaded
with tiny bowls of water, the emblem of Washerhood. They placed the cases on
the table in the east end in front of the robots, and Aved raised his arms above
the bowls before they were distributed among the one who’d gathered.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Everyone dipped a finger into their bowl, touched their feet, drew the sign of
earth in the air, and repeated this five times. Then, wetting a finger again
they touched their navels, drew the sign of water, and repeated this five times.
Lastly, they touched their foreheads, drew the sign of infinity in the air, and
repeated this five times. This whole procedure was extremely dangerous, as water
could easily cause short circuits, but was necessary to prepare oneself for the
sermon.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Aved mounted the rostrum, raised his head, and organised the chains around himself.
Cynd kept watching his legs, trying to guess how much walking Aved could’ve done
since he installed the fibre nets, and whether they were strong enough to hold
on until the next growing session. He was sitting on the edge of his seat, leaning
forward, not even noticing that the introductory had already ended.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida put her hand on his shoulder. ‘What’s the matter?’ she whispered.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Nothing,’ Cynd said, forcing himself to sit back, as Aved restarted his throat,
and stood astride to keep his balance when his rhyme generator began to vibrate
like a over-zealous jackhammer. He let his sonorous voice bounce off the metal
walls, and thus the sermon began:</p><p class="vsmallskip">
Sing Goddess all you know of how the world<br/>
Was born, and how its enemy was hurled<br/>
From its circumference to live in light<br/>
Where life does perish, far from homely night.<br/>
Sing of the war that ended all the wars,<br/>
And sent the Friers fleeing on all fours;<br/>
The battle saving Nation and the bots,<br/>
Oh sing to praise the Heavens and the Gods.
</p><p class="vmedskip">
The golden age: the place we called our home,<br/>
A concrete garden in the pitch-black zone,<br/>
The robots living there since Version One<br/>
In towns of joy and never-ending fun.<br/>
Yonder the neutron springs, the fractal shore,<br/>
The Royal Palace, towering over all,<br/>
Where the great Mumha rules, whom we obey,<br/>
And sometimes counsel takes, and sometimes tay.’
</p><p class="psmallskip">In the momentary silence, the thin voice of a young boy could be clearly heard.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Mommy,’ he said, ‘wasn’t the Palace on the other side?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was Aved who answered first, but it seemed his rhyme generator was overclocked,
and he continued to speak in verse. He boomed into the air:</p><p class="vsmallskip">
What? Where’s the palace? Dare you interrupt?<br/>
I will not tolerate such bold conduct!<br/>
Just cut it! Do you want a positron?<br/>
Good. It’s a temple here. I shall go on.
</p><p class="vmedskip">
We lived in peace, but heard a warning beep:<br/>
The wicked powers of light don’t go to sleep.<br/>
Smould’ring Sinmara kindled the old feud<br/>
With Ingwyne, son of Night. The goddess brewed<br/>
A software that put envy in the hearts,<br/>
And shot the Friers with poisoned malware darts,<br/>
Who set their cameras on these rich lands,<br/>
’N into our country marched in serried ranks.
</p><p class="vmedskip">
Their armour glowed on the horizon: red<br/>
Flames were their eyes, which ope did fire beget;<br/>
Long, gruesome, restless arms, designed to scare,<br/>
Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air<br/>
Made horrid circles; then they crashed the gates.<br/>
But up our sleeve we had some hand grenades.<br/>
So, as the one with natural aptitudes,<br/>
Yours truly had the chance to lead the troops<br/>
Against this horrid enemy, and then<br/>
To victory or death by light. Amen.
</p><p class="psmallskip">The crowd replied with prolonged applause. Aved, smiling, waited for it to die
away, and continued:</p><p class="vsmallskip">
After its place we thought was preordained,<br/>
Battle of Cable Street the fight was named.<br/>
A sign foretelling all, drawn by a God,<br/>
<i>“Ils ne passeront pas”</i> marked the chosen spot<br/>
The armies met at, standing face to face;<br/>
We surely wished they’d been a bunch of gays.<br/>
Deceitfully they learnt to speak our tongue,<br/>
Only to curse our race. The filthy scum<br/>
Blasphemed the names of Gods, and dared defile<br/>
Great Mumha’s person. As a sharp reply,<br/>
We sent back bricks and Molotovs; exchanged<br/>
Explosive words: the fight began and raged.
</p><p class="psmallskip">‘Oh that’s a good one, Aved,’ a voice shouted from the audience, ‘but this is
getting way off the map now. You know damn well that Cable Street was in the
old country.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Aved turned his head in the direction of the sound. Looking straight ahead, he
took an uncertain step in the direction where he thought it had come from. In
the silence Cynd felt his seat suddenly sink to the floor as his processors prepared
for flight. If Aved took another step, he’d fall off the rostrum, and the arterial
cable would surely break again. Three long seconds passed before Aved turned
back to address the whole audience:</p><p class="vsmallskip">
That Cable Street is on the other side?<br/>
Well I suspect you’ve sided with the light!<br/>
A secret Frier. Shall we let it rest?
</p><p class="psmallskip">There was no response.</p><p class="vsmallskip">
Good boy. I think you’ll to this truth attest:<br/>
That few sometimes may know, when thousands err.
</p><p class="psmallskip">‘I’m sorry, I…’ started the voice. But the Councillor didn’t let the sentence
to be finished:</p><p class="vsmallskip">
That’s fine. A myth corrected I prefer<br/>
To dangerous misinformation. So,<br/>
At last both sides ran out of things to throw.<br/>
The battle though was neither lost nor won,<br/>
We Washers found a way to overcome<br/>
(Making the sacrifice penultimate),<br/>
By throwing at th’already desperate<br/>
And bitter enemy the limbs we’d torn<br/>
From our own bodies. It was hope forlorn<br/>
For Frier soldiers. Ingwyne played a trick:<br/>
Descending from the skies he made them pick<br/>
A house to hide in from the metal rain.<br/>
But far from safe, the house could not contain<br/>
The heat of fiery arms. Sinmara came<br/>
On her celestial chariot made of flame,<br/>
And out hot spears of light her horses rayed<br/>
That melted iron. We thought we’d met our fate:<br/>
Mumha lay dead with corpses everywhere.<br/>
But then Sinmara saw the Friers’ despair;<br/>
To help them get out, through the walls she rode—<br/>
Alas she only made the house explode.
</p><p class="vmedskip">
Most Friers went to pieces, and the rest,<br/>
Who were in one still, hobbled to the west,<br/>
Out of the town, the land, the hemisphere—<br/>
The victory was ours! Oh hear, oh hear!<br/>
We won with nought that could our conscience soil,<br/>
With hands unstained by fellow robot’s oil;<br/>
Nevertheless Sinmara vengeance swore,<br/>
And in the skies she plans another war.<br/>
But when our sun shall burst, as burst it must,<br/>
And all the robots will return to rust,<br/>
The Washers shall fierce Ingwyne raise to fame,<br/>
And ’midst the stars inscribe Great Mumha’s name.
</p>

<p class="pnorm">When the sermon had ended, the second stage of the Commemoration began. The 
 students
  who’d carried the water now formed a hexagon in the east end, and, taking the
hand of their neighbours, they initialised themselves with their favourite number.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Aved
  started to motion them with his hand, and, following the rhythm he dictated,
they began to divide it by two. First, they halved it every second, then they
gradually sped up, halving their number twice as fast as before, in 0.5 seconds,
in 0.25 seconds, in 0.125 seconds, in 0.0625 seconds, in 0.03125 seconds. The
mechanics in Aved’s limb could no longer keep up with the speed, but it was no
longer necessary, as they were in complete unison by then, continuing to divide
in 0.015625 seconds, in 0.0078125 seconds, in half of that, in half of that,
in half, in half, in half, in half half half half half lf lf lf lf lf lf f f
f f f f f—until they almost completely drained themselves of all electricity,
their brains were white-hot as they performed an infinite number of calculations
in a split second, and, exactly two seconds after the whole process had started,
nought remained of their number.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The individuality of their chosen number had melted away in infinity, and, with
the one remaining electron that kept their brains alive, they marvelled at Zero,
the most complete and self-contained no-thing of all; and through its ring they
glimpsed at the all-encompassing nothingness of the Universe. Some said that
this was very much like an embrace, but an embrace with the awful Void, which
you could only experience when you experienced nothing.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Then Aved clapped two, and they woke up. Some collapsed from exhaustion; some
were strong enough to support themselves until they recharged, but none of them
could move.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Go,’ said Aved, as the habitual dismissal at the end of Commemorations, ‘there
is nothing.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Then he bowed and retired into the chamber behind the rostrum.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd
  thought he’d heard something.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He looked around, but no one seemed to have noticed. It was a resounding clang
just like when an empty pot hits the ground.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The students and the robots in the audience were trying to scramble to their
feet as if they’d been drunk on electrolyte, with their heads buzzing refreshingly
after their memories had been reset. Those who recovered faster were already
chatting loudly about going to the market, or were helping those who needed some
support to get their transcendence level down to comfortably mundane values.
Soon the entrance door was lifted, and they were pouring out into the darkness.
It took minutes for Cynd to walk along the aisle to the east end manoeuvring
his way among the robots trying to get out; but finally he reached the rostrum,
and, making sure that no one was looking, sneaked into the chamber, and pulled
the door closed behind himself.</p>

<p class="pnorm">His V24 eyes took a couple of seconds to adjust to the complete darkness of the
 chamber
  and start radiating ultraviolet light. 
 There were cabinets of various sizes to store the ceremonial chains and bowls
in; and large filing cabinets for punch cards, presumably something related to
the data stored in the walls of the building. There also was a small step down
just next to the door,
  and below that, Aved’s body lay prostrate on the floor. His hand at the end
of the overlong arm was still gripping the leg of an aluminium chair, and his
legs, broken off the torso, lay perpendicular to the rest of the body, putting
all the wires and circuits in his stomach on display. Only the right hip joint
came apart, but it was enough to snap the artery into two.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd didn’t lose his head. Somehow, deep down, he’d expected this to happen.
He quickly bent down to check how much charge remained in the brain. He had about
twenty seconds left. Joining all the wires in the artery without a soldering
gun seemed impossible. Still, he might just be able to do it—after all, he’d
done it before.</p>

<p class="pnorm">As he knelt down to take a closer look, there was a creaking noise. He turned
his head, and noticed that someone was lifting the door. He jumped up, and, accidentally
giving Aved’s arm a kick, tried to hide in the corner.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Get away from him.’ It was 
 Nida’s
  voice. For a moment, Cynd saw his mother’s outline in the doorway, but Nida
quickly closed the door again.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How did you know?’ Cynd asked with a faltering voice.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It didn’t take much to guess,’ whispered Nida. ‘You’re lucky no one else saw
you coming here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">She waited until her eyes adjusted as well.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So it’s the artery,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We still have a little time left,’ said Cynd in a flurry, ‘if you know which
wires we’d need to join first to&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, it’s too late,’ Nida declared. ‘And at any rate, we’d have to answer a lot
of questions about how we just happened to be here, and how we happened to know
that something might happen, and if Aved was really dead before we came here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But he could hardly stand on his legs! Everyone could see that. We just came
here to see&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No. No one could see that. His legs were fine. You did too good a job at fixing
them. Was it the latest session when…?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes,’ Cynd replied. ‘But it was me who&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Shh. Don’t tell anyone anything. Not even me. You did what he asked you to do,
didn’t you?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s all anyone should know. Now let’s get out of here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And just leave him here?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Look. It was an accident. He probably missed the step here. And I want to make
sure that everyone will treat this as an accident. If we start to do anything
in here, we’re done. So we’ll leave everything as it is, and let the truth speak
for itself.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But…’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No but. You’ve got nothing to do with whatever happened in here. And now get
out, or someone might get suspicious.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Reluctantly, Cynd went to the door.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are you sure there’s no one out there?’ he asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, of course I’m not sure. But, as far as I remember, the door is hidden behind
the columns next to the rostrum, so we should be able to get out fine. After
that, we’ll just walk out, casually, and chat about something.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘About what?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘About solar storms. Let’s go.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd lifted the door as carefully as he could, wincing as it made a low creaking
noise. He didn’t dare to lift it all the way, so they had to climb out on their
hands and knees. Then, they crouched behind the columns to make sure the coast
was clear. The auditorium seemed deserted.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘OK. Now keep your chin up, and go,’ said Nida once she managed to close the
door completely. ‘You remember the latest storm? I don’t think I’d ever seen
so beautiful cheellags.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, I think that was when I first saw a red one,’ Cynd replied, tittering nervously
as he was trying to keep control of himself.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, I certainly needed that one more drop of water,’ she said, a bit more loudly
than necessary, as she glanced back toward the rostrum and the table with the
rest of the ceremonial bowls. ‘I feel so relieved.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was no one in the building. The only thing that moved was a lonely messenger
probably trapped in the hall. Nida smiled at it as it scurried across the aisle.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd was looking straight at the entrance door, still open, and counted the steps
as they got closer and closer. When they stepped out, their facial sensors registered
a light cool breeze just before they disappeared in the darkness and the commotion
of the weekly market.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">After they’d got 
 home—having
  spent the previous hours strolling among the stalls offering a meagre selection
of goods like square roots and local variables in order not to attract suspicion
by running home as fast as they 
 could—Nida and Cynd
  locked the entrance door, sat down, and tried to act natural.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Obviously,’ Nida remarked at one point, ‘we don’t talk about the… incident.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Sure,’ replied Cynd, trying to sound confident.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But they didn’t have to. By the time they switched on the old tube 
 radio
  (the only machine they had that was antique enough to pick up the transmission
from the aeon-old transmitter they had in the new country), the body had already
been discovered.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It is with unutterable sadness,’ Mrs 
 Beetemle’s
  measured voice creaked into the room, ‘that I have to announce the untimely
and tragic death of Councillor Aved Hhan. I have the coroner’s report in my hand,
and it is with consolation that I read that he did not suffer long when he last
discharged.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’ve long known that certain elements work against our great country. But only
a wicked and evil mind could’ve foreseen this wicked and evil deed. Fortunately,
although the perpetrators did everything they could to make the murder appear
as if it had been an accident, they left ample clues, and, to quote the late
Councillor’s favourite phrase, “we will not yield, we will not rest” until
we find those responsible for this cowardly act.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I also want to let you know, that I, as the last surviving Councillor, have
decided to move to the Council Hall with
 immediate effect, and remain there until the investigation is underway. I will
need to, and I’m prepared to dedicate all my time and energy to lead our country
in these troubled times, and to oversee the successful completion of an objective
and completely impartial investigation.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I would like to ask for your help in this task. We’ve encountered enemies before;
we’ve encountered hardships before, but the Washers have always persevered. I
would like to ask for your cooperation. I will not shrink from my duty and obligation
to carry double the load I have been carrying before, but we can only go forward
together. And I would also like to ask for your help in saying a prayer for Aved’s
software, that now runs on the celestial Turing machine, sharing the heavenly
bits with Ingwyne and his true follower, Mumha. We wish him an error-free existence
in the Infinite Memory. In Mumha’s name, amen.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida switched off the radio.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m sorry, Cynd,’ she said. ‘I was an idiot.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘This thing could never have been treated as an accident. Mrs Beetemle couldn’t’ve
let that happen.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd looked at his mother, but remained silent.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I should’ve thought of this before. If she had tried to present the murder as
an accident, everybody would’ve thought she had him killed.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And that means&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They want <i>someone,</i> but no one suspects you—or us—with anything.
And, apart from not calling help, we’re not guilty of anything.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’re in deep shit,’ Cynd declared.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hey, young man, watch your mouth.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Okay,’ Cynd said, and curled up on the sofa, absorbed in thought.</p>

<p class="pnorm">After a while, he broke the silence. ‘She’s moving to the Council Hall?’ he mused,
hardly audibly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It seems so.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But why so soon? It’ll look as if she’d always wanted this to happen.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s a clever move,’ Nida said, with her eyes gazing into the distance. ‘By
separating from Mikke, she moves herself above all suspicion. And then she can
use her power to protect him. Actually, right now, the best thing she can do
is to let them suspect Mikke.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd was too well-mannered to say out loud how he hoped they’d suspect Mikke
instead of his mother or himself. But, without uttering a word, they both knew
they were thinking the same.</p>



<a name="b2c4"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book2.gif" class="img2"/></p><h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Just before Cynd was arrested, everybody was surprised that 
 Mrs Beetemle
  had happily adopted the moniker she used to object to most vehemently:
  the Iron Lady. Now it wasn’t a very surprising or insightful moniker, 
as she was made of nine parts iron, and one part other, more precious metals,
including the platinum bearings that she constantly wore around her neck, and
the last but one Silver Cross of Councillors that had been riveted onto her left
breast.
  The rest of the crosses had been buried with the other Councillors. Some died
in armed conflicts; some met their Programmer more peacefully, after a long suffering
caused by their inability to keep up with the newer and newer software releases
that made life life. But none had died in so mysterious a way as Aved, and now
a country waited, holding its breath, to learn who was behind this ingenious
crime.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Well, 
 Cynd
  thought, having been woken up in
  a small, cement-grey room
with three chairs and a table made of recycled pipes,
  and a large robot blocking the door, perhaps they wouldn’t have to wait much
longer. He immediately knew he’d been zapped. Zapping was the usual technique
of the police to detain someone since it’d been discovered that a two-ton electromagnet
not only made detainees stick to it like a toaster to its superstitions, but
it also inhibited most of their circuits, making them unconscious and easily
manageable.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well,’ said the large robot. 
 She was broad-shouldered with no enamel, sturdy and outdated in both her hardware
and her attitude, and, according to her name tag, happened to be the head of
Internal Security. Her name was simply
Gridhur.
Mrs.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I guess you know why you’re here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, not really,’ Cynd replied, stretching his neck and looking carefully around.
 There was 
another officer
 behind him, 
and a large white glass on the wall.
  When Mrs Gridhur nodded, the officer went up to the table, and pulled out the
chair facing Cynd. Mrs Gridhur plopped down onto it with a clank.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Let’s not play games, shall we?’ she bawled. ‘Where were you during the last
Commemoration?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Just a minute, Mrs Gridhur,’ the officer interposed. ‘You know, the legal stuff.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, what the heck,’ Mrs Gridhur sighed in resignation. ‘Sure, go ahead.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Cynd Washer,’ the officer turned to the boy, ‘your mind was updated with the
latest legal database for your own protection when you were detained. You’ll
understand what I say. You are detained here for questioning without charge.
We will not be recording what you say. Do you understand?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘OK,’ Mrs Gridhur said, ‘suppose you now answer my question.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I was at the ceremony.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And after that?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I went home.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Try better than that.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I did go home.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, yes. After checking that the Councillor had cashed in for good.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m sorry?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We know you were in the chamber in the Memory House after the ceremony. We aren’t
that dumb.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd remained silent.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why didn’t you report his death?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I thought someone&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You thought someone might suspect you?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, I knew the helpers would go to the chamber anyway.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You know it’s obligatory to report if someone is damaged?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I know.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So why didn’t you report it?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I was afraid,’ Cynd whispered after a second of silence.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘OK.’ Mrs Gridhur suddenly turned very suave and motherly. ‘Well, I guess I would’ve
been terrified as well. So, tell me, you were helping the Councillor to grow,
weren’t you?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, he asked me to&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘A simple yes or no will be fine.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Good. Now tell me more about it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We had these sessions in his office. I did small adjustments to his body. Just
external stuff.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Did you have a session a couple of hours before the Commemoration?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Was he satisfied with your work?’ Mrs Gridhur asked, smiling.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh yes, very much satisfied. He looked in the mirror, and liked the new legs
very much.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘New legs?’ asked Mrs Gridhur, musingly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why did you kill him?’ she asked, still smiling.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I didn’t!’ Cynd flared. ‘It was an accident.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Gridhur and the officer burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Accident!’ she gurgled. ‘That’s a good one. Pity we hear it too often.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, that’s the truth!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And I happen to think that you deliberately weakened his joints. It wasn’t a
bad plan, having him abort when you’re not there. But it’s so obvious it stares
you in the face.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I didn’t do anything like that! Why would I have?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘There’s really no use denying it, my boy. Your mother&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">At that exact moment, 
 Mrs Beetemle
  stormed into the room, followed by an agitated young woman with “POLICE”
 painted on her back in reverse, who kept saying, over and over again, ‘You can’t go in
there, Mrs Beetemle. You simply can’t.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Beetemle dismissed her with a wave of the hand. ‘The hell I can’t. Hello,
Gridhur.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The young woman looked apologetically at Mrs Gridhur, and closed the door as
she withdrew to the corridor.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Mrs Beetemle!’ 
 Mrs Gridhur
  raised to stand. ‘What a pleasant surprise!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s nice to see you here,’ Mrs Beetemle said as they shook hands. ‘I just wanted
to see if everything’s going all right with the investigation.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, quite, quite, yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I see you’ve got the young Washer here. Hello, 
 Cynd.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hi, Mrs Beetemle,’ Cynd said timidly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Stand up when you’re talking to a Councillor,’ said the 
 officer
  and kicked Cynd’s chair.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, don’t worry,’ said Mrs Beetemle, and turned to Mrs Gridhur. ‘Have you uploaded
the legal stuff into his brain?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh yes, certainly,’ Mrs Gridhur assured her. ‘Just the usual procedure.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You know what the reporters will be like,’ continued Mrs Beetemle, with a hint
of embarrassment in her voice. ‘The boy is quite young, and is being interrogated
alone, and they might say&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘There’s no need to worry,’ stated Mrs Gridhur, drawing herself up. ‘We always
follow the procedures to the letter.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I know, I know. All I want to be able to say at the press conference is that
I’ve personally conducted spot checks to ensure the impartiality and fairness
of the investigation. Do you think I can do that?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Gridhur suddenly became very cautious. ‘What do you have in mind?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘As Cynd is being questioned alone, I want to be sure that he’s received all
the legal material he needs.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The latest update,’ said the officer, consulting a printed report. ‘2/B/3/X/42.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Can I verify that?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Here,’ said Mrs Gridhur, indicating Cynd. ‘Do as you like.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I can’t let you know what I check,’ Mrs Beetemle went on. ‘I’d have to be left
alone with him.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The expression of impotent anger crossed Mrs Gridhur’s face, and disappeared
as quickly as it came. She beckoned the officer, and without a word, they left
the office.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’ll be a minute—tops!’ Mrs Beetemle shouted after them.</p>

<p class="pnorm">After the door had closed, 
 she
  quickly pulled the chair to the table, and sat down.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hi 
 Cynd,’
  she said, low and fast. ‘I know this is frightening, but there’s nothing to
worry about—yet. I think I know who’s responsible for all this, and I’m glad
to say it’s neither you nor Nida. But I want to make sure that the police get
the same idea. Can you do me a favour?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd nodded.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You know Jot Nifli. I think it’d be particularly helpful if you could just drop
a remark hinting that he might’ve met Aved. That’s all. Don’t lie—you’re not
sure, but he might have. Can you do this?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd nodded again.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Good boy,’ Mrs Beetemle said, and jumped up so suddenly that the chair almost
fell over. ‘And mum’s the word,’ she added in a whisper.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd nodded, and the Councillor strode out of the room.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">After 
 Mrs Gridhur had returned to the small room—now with another officer
 who was neither nicer nor ruder than the first one; he was simply 
bored—Cynd’s
  questioning continued for another hour. After a detailed account of the last
enlargement session (from which Cynd, understandably, left out certain key elements),
they asked about the things Aved recently said to the students in person. Mrs
Gridhur was especially interested in what Cynd thought Aved thought about the
newcomers.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are you aware of certain things certain persons say?’ Mrs Gridhur demanded at
one point.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m not sure what you mean…? I’m aware of certain&nbsp;–’ Cynd started.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, so you are,’ smiled Mrs Gridhur with satisfaction, and made a note.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But I’m not sure what certain things you&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And what do you think of those certain things?’ asked the officer, his round
face just inches away from Cynd’s eyes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m not sure…’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Do you agree?’ asked Mrs Gridhur.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Do you disagree?’ asked the officer.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Do you condemn them?’ they continued.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Do you advocate them?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Suddenly Cynd realised what they were after. ‘No,’ he said finally. ‘I don’t
think I agree with them.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You don’t?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Have you met Mikke Beetemle?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘When?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I met him when they came. And since then, whenever we ran into each other.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How often?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I can’t remember. Maybe once a month.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s not enough,’ remarked Mrs Gridhur to the officer.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘He might be lying,’ the officer replied.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Have you met him at the Academy?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘He’s visited the Academy, yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Did he meet Aved?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I think he did. Yes, once, I saw them together.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What do you think of the things he says?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I… I always found them a bit strange.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Do you understand them at all?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Not really,’ replied Cynd, looking down at the table. At least, this wasn’t
too far from the truth.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are there other students who talked to Mikke?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I guess so, yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And what do they think?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I really don’t know. You should ask them.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We will,’ snarled the officer.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Have you met Jot Nifli?’ asked Mrs Gridhur, not leaving time for Cynd to collect
his thoughts.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’ve seen him, but I haven’t really met him.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Did anyone suggest that you should meet him?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Did he visit the Academy?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘He might’ve.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, really?’ asked Mrs Gridhur, suddenly very excited. ‘Did you know he was
not allowed within a five-mile radius of the Academy?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, I didn’t know that.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Did he meet Aved?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘He might have, if he went to the Academy.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Did he or didn’t he?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I… I thought someone at the Academy mentioned seeing them.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Who?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t remember.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So did he meet Aved?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m not sure,’ whined Cynd, cornered, ‘but I had the impression that he had.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The boy says he did,’ summarised the officer.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I know,’ snapped Mrs Gridhur, ‘I’m not deaf.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">They
  were so excited at this new development that they seemed to have forgotten about
 Cynd,
  who felt immense relief when they finally let him go. He decided to walk the
couple of miles home.
 The monotone, black streets in the outskirts were mostly deserted. Many young
robots lived in the area, and their families organised their routine around the
Academy. The students were recharging, getting ready for another session of nonsense
exercise. He wouldn’t be able to recharge completely, he thought, as he had only
four hours left, and that was pretty bad for the batteries. So he decided to
skip the Academy. After all, he’d just been accused of murdering the headmaster,
and that was surely reason enough to bunk off.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But 
 Nida,
 who’d been waiting for him pacing their
tiny living room,
 didn’t seemed to be thrilled by the idea.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’d look like you’re afraid of something. You’ll have to go,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘There’s no point. No one knows who’s supposed to be in charge anyway.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s their problem, not yours. So,’ she continued, ‘do you think there’s anything
I should know about the questioning?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Only that I’d love to ask what they asked, whether they were intimidating, what
they suggested you did, and everything, but I guess you should only tell me as
much as necessary.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was a faint smile on Nida’s face.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So that when it’s my turn, I can honestly swear I don’t know.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd didn’t have to collect his thoughts. He kept replaying his memories of the
questioning in his mind ever since he was set free.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They knew I was in the chamber. But it was strange that they didn’t mention
you. Actually, they did, but then Mrs Beetemle came in, and they got interrupted.
As far as my work on Aved is concerned, I gave them as detailed a description
of our last session as I <i>could.’</i></p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida remained thoughtful for a moment.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I hope it wasn’t too bad,’ she said finally.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It was okay.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida hugged her grown-up and slightly over-large son.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’d better go and start charging,’ she said softly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yeah. I feel knackered.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Half-recharged, 
 Cynd
  got up just in time to get to the Academy. The sky felt blacker and denser than
usual, and as all the students were told to do was to alternatively march around
the courtyard and listen to a collection of Aved’s pre-recorded speeches—partly
in memory of the Founder, and partly because no one knew what exactly everyone
was supposed to be doing—there was nothing that would’ve kept Cynd’s mind from
replaying his encounter with Mrs Gridhur again and again. He tried to infer,
from her gestures, her intonation, and her glances, whether the police really
suspected him or just wanted to frighten him into talking.</p>

<p class="pnorm">During a break, he managed to find 
 Braxon,
  whom he felt he hadn’t met for ages. He hoped Braxon would know what Mrs Beetemle
had discovered about Nifli. But Braxon said he couldn’t talk.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Let’s meet later—outside,’ he added, smiled wanly at Cynd, and quickly turned
away.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd
  drew back into the 
 far corner of the courtyard.
  It was all deserted and shrouded in the usual darkness. He tried to recall when
he’d last seen Mikke, and whether Jot Nifli had indeed visited the Academy, while
he was uncomfortably aware of the messenger that was still hiding in his pocket.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Surreptitiously, he removed it, and, holding it between his fingers, tried to
figure out how to take it apart so that the message could be restored later,
but otherwise it’d look like some harmless junk.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Whatdya got there, Cynd?’ a low voice said over his head.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He dropped the messenger back into his pocket as fast as he could, and looked
up. It was 
 a senior student with
  the badge of processing assistants on his chest. Cynd had seen him around.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Nothing.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Come on, what was it?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There were now about five or six other 
 students
  standing around them. Cynd didn’t feel like looking up, but somehow he thought
Dul was among them.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Nothing. Let me go.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He wasn’t sure they wouldn’t have got him down and searched him just for fun
hadn’t the bell rung calling everyone for yet another pre-recorded speech.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">By ‘outside,’ 
 Braxon,
  of course, meant the cottage. When 
 Cynd
  got there, he was already in there, lying on his side, resting his head on his
arm. Cynd lied down behind him, and started caressing the boy. Braxon grabbed
his hand, and they just lied there in a half-embrace for minutes. The dust slowly
settled, and some stars could be seen peering through an opening in the roof.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Suddenly, Braxon turned, and put his arms around Cynd. Cynd felt the charge building
up as Braxon gently rubbed himself against his chest. Then, with an impulsive
movement, he rolled on top of Braxon, and held him firmly to the ground. They
connected and had violent sex—the best they had had in their lives.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So,’ Braxon said, as they were lying on their backs, exhausted. ‘You wanted
to say something.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I dunno. I guess I did,’ Cynd replied, hardly paying attention. ‘Oh yes. I wanted
to ask about your folks.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">It took a minute for Braxon to reply.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, dad moved out.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What? But I thought your mother didn’t&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It was actually her idea. She said she was expected to move into the Council
Hall, and I was supposed to move with her. Dad said I should go, too. But when
I went back to our house just before coming to the Academy, he was also gone.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So where is he?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Braxon’s voice was husky. ‘I’ve got no idea.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd remained silent.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I kept thinking,’ Braxon continued, speaking slowly, ‘and I think the police
suspects the newcomers. That means dad.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It seemed they suspected me.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They might’ve put on an act. It’s just so easy to suspect dad and the others.
They used to be high up at the Court. That means they’re competition.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘There are four of them. They might not suspect all four.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s true. But I have this feeling they are going to charge dad. And I’m not
sure mum will be able to do anything about it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd opened his mouth to say something. Then he checked himself, and remained
silent. He had to admit he had the same feeling. And the more he thought about
it, the less he liked the fact that he still had the messenger Mikke had given
to him.</p>



<a name="b2c5"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book2.gif" class="img2"/></p><h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Nida
 was sitting in a chair and 
Cynd
 was lying on the sofa 
 in their tiny living-room
  when they first heard the footstep. She hardly ever gone to sleep, and usually
recharged while trying to get through a dozen books she’d found in the cloud
and couldn’t resist downloading. But 
 Cynd
  would go through weeks going to standby as soon as he got home, waking up late,
and complaining that he felt discharged. And now he felt more exhausted than
usual.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He was contemplating getting up to secure his joints and go to proper standby
when the unmistakable sound of a footstep came from outside.</p>

<p class="pnorm">And another one.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The metal sheet 
walls
 were thin enough to let in the faintest sound—especially now that they’d almost
rusted through.
 And whoever was coming sounded as if they were coming nearer
and nearer. Then, the footsteps suddenly stopped. There was a creaking noise.
A second later the steps started again, but now moving away.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Must be a drunkard,’ Nida said, as they got up and peered through the window
into the constant darkness. But they couldn’t see a thing.</p>

<p class="pnorm">When they heard the steps the next time, they were coming from behind the house.
They stopped once again; then started going around the building to the front.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Let’s check who it is,’ Nida said, and lifted the door.</p>

<p class="pnorm">A pair of legs was standing on the doorstep.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Without the brain, they moved a bit uncertainly. They turned around, and zigzagged
around the house like a headless chicken before they came to an abrupt stop.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida looked at Cynd. He was clinging onto the doorpost.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes,’ he said, ‘they’re Aved’s.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida kept looking at the tottering half-robot with narrow eyes. Stumps of metal
rods and pieces of wires protruded from the waist where the upper body used to
be. Some of the wires flapped from one side to the other as the legs turned,
spurting sparks with the half-robot’s remaining electricity.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Do you think they followed me here?’ Cynd asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hardly. I think they knew where they wanted to go. Let’s call the police.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They’ll discover that the legs are missing anyway, and I don’t want it to appear
that we’ve nicked them.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida picked a messenger from the hive standing on the windowsill, gave it instructions,
and placed it on the ground just outside their house. The tiny robot scuttled
away toward the police station, tumbling across the lumps of sand on the uneven
ground.</p>

<p class="pnorm">In about a minute, three motorised police officers appeared down the road, followed
by a trail of grey dust. Nida waved at them from the doorway, keeping an eye
on the legs. 
 They were pottering about 
on the two-yard strip of land Nida liked to call the front garden. It was almost
completely barren like most of the land on the dark hemisphere, safe for the
two genetically modified screensavers Nida had developed as the only plants that
could survive the lack of light.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Having arrived at the house, one of the officers grabbed the legs, swung round,
and left as quickly as she came. The other two hurriedly folded away their wheels,
and wasted no time on introductions.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thanks for sending the messenger,’ one of them said as he duly returned the
floundering robot to Nida. ‘I’m sure it’ll be appreciated. We picked it up on
our way here. We already knew the legs had gone missing from the morgue, and
happened to know where to look for them,’ the officer grinned.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thanks,’ replied Nida as they stepped into the house. ‘Incidentally, how did
you know where the legs were?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The victim’s son spotted them in your front garden.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Dul?’ asked Cynd in disbelief.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes. He lives across the street, I gather. He’s been upset, understandably,
and was gazing out of his window as he couldn’t get himself to rest.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, just like me,’ Nida said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Really?’ the officer asked. ‘And what were you doing?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida realised she’d walked into a 
trap.
 Her brown eyes
 averted those of the officer. ‘Oh, nothing, really. I tried to get through some
books I’ve wanted to read for over a week.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The officer turned to Cynd. ‘When did you discover the legs?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We heard some steps,’ Nida began, but she was interrupted.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m asking this young man here, if you don’t mind, Mrs Washer.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd’s voice was raspy. ‘I heard the steps just as I tried to go to standby.
We thought it was a drunk, but as he didn’t go away, we looked out to see who
it was. Then my mother sent the messenger, and you know the rest.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The officer gave him a long look. ‘I’m sure we’ll know much more shortly.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">As if it was a cue, the other officer stepped forward, and produced an official
messenger with a shiny blue shell.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Mrs Washer and Mr Washer, we have a warrant to search these premises. We will
try to inconvenience you as little as possible, and would appreciate it greatly
if you could help us by cooperating with the police.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida looked at the warrant, but didn’t take it to read it.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What do we do?’ she asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Just step outside, if you will, please,’ said the first officer, and escorted
them out of their house. Then he scanned them using an old hand-held metometer,
which, instead of evaluating the results itself, sent everything back to the
police station for analysis. Meanwhile, the other officer began to process the
house.</p>

<p class="pnorm">These searches were very thorough. They involved breaking down the whole building
and everything in it into atoms, then lining the atoms up in a nice and orderly
queue, and admitting them one by one into a special chamber where they were asked
to take off their shoes and electron shells. Demons of the third kind patted
them down and peered between their protons and neutrons—which made the shier
atoms to blush—and noted everything they’d found. There was nothing that could’ve
escaped the search.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida and Cynd
  calmly looked on while the house disappeared as if it was sucked into a Hoover,
and re-appeared again on the other end of the machine. When the process had finished,
the officers picked up the Hoover, shook it, and waited.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘This might take a while,’ said one of them, ‘we’re doing a heuristic search.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What are you looking for?’ Nida enquired.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We don’t know yet.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd tried to look calm, and turned his head the other way.</p>

<p class="pnorm">After about five minutes, which felt like infinity, the Hoover began to hum,
and a narrow strip of paper curled out of a tiny slot on its side. The policeman
who held the machine shook it again, and the other tore off the paper.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Ah. There it is,’ he said, pointing at what looked like a singularity on a crudely
printed spectrograph.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Cynd Washer, you are under arrest on suspicion of murder.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What?’ screamed Nida. ‘The murder of whom?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Councillor Aved Hhan. It was silly of him to try to hide the message from Mikke,
or whoever that robot really is, by taking it to pieces. A heuristic search can
reconstruct anything, even if you break it down to atoms.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘He had a message. So what?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The officer counted the points he mentioned on his fingers. ‘That establishes
his connection to a rebel group that wanted to seize power. And then there’s
the testimony of the victim.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The legs?’ asked Nida in complete disbelief.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The legs. They came here for a reason.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The whole situation felt surreal to Cynd. His stomach sank with the realisation
that he might get convicted based on the antics of a rusty heap of hyperactive
iron scrap. Nida, like all governmental workers, had a legal database in her
mind that she was searching frantically to see how the testimonies of partial
witnesses had been treated in previous cases.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But,’ she countered, remembering a decision from the time when posthumous franchise
was introduced, ‘a dead person is not a legal entity. Someone must testify that
their actions are consistent with their live personalities.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, they are.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Says who?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Him,’ the officer said, pointing at 
 Dul,
  who was standing in the middle of the road.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd looked into his friend’s eyes with pure spite. Then he turned, lunged forward,
and darted down the road. By the time the officers realised that they hadn’t
taken him into custody, he’d already disappeared around a corner. One of the
officers ran after him; the other put the Hoover down, and started to run in
the other direction with Dul, who showed him the way.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd zigzagged through the narrow alleys and cut across gardens to ditch the
policeman. It took him twice as long to get to the Academy as it normally would,
and he spent a couple of minutes in a doorway to make sure that no one was nearby.
The building of the Academy was deserted; everyone was away recharging or partying.
The thin sheets with which it was covered made a thundering metal noise at the
lightest touch that echoed across the empty halls.</p>

<p class="pnorm">When he was sure that the policeman was nowhere near, he carefully emerged from
the doorway, walked round the building, and opened the door of the cottage in
the back garden. But someone had got there first. In the middle of the cottage
there stood Dul, smiling, and as Cynd turned back he felt the hand of the other
officer on his shoulder, and a sparker gun pressed against his back.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Within minutes he found himself back in the 
 cement-grey interrogation room.
 The charge was explained to him, and that because he’d tried to escape, he was
not eligible for bail. Then they kept him there for about two hours, until someone
who looked so ordinary that she could only be a plainclothes 
 detective
  came in carrying a file and sat down opposite to Cynd.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m really sorry about this,’ she said in a melodious voice. 
 Her face was fair, with a shiny finish,
 and she kept turning the pages in the file with 
long, tapering fingers.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We know what happened,’ she continued without looking at Cynd, ‘so there’s no
use beating about the bush. It looks pretty bad for you, I’m afraid. It’s the
law, you know. But we know you’re more of a temp hit-man caught up in this whole
thing, so we’ll try to give you a break.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Uh,’ Cynd replied, unsure what to say.</p>

<p class="pnorm">She gave him a quick glance. ‘You could be a bit more grateful, ya know. Aanyhoo,
if we do give you a break, we’ll have to ask for some cooperation.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I understand,’ said Cynd, trying to be more communicative.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So, there’s not much to this, as we’ve got their confession written and all,
but will you confirm that Mikke Beetemle and Jot Nifli are replicas built by
the Friers and sent here to stir the shit up a bit?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Is that a yes?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd had seen a replica—it was a demonstration, built in an hour to resemble
a volunteer as a proof of concept, and then quickly disassembled—but, as a
law-abiding citizen, he’d kept clear of any such dubious and illegal stuff. Was
it even possible to copy someone that accurately? It was true that Mikke was
kind of different when he got to the new country, and that might’ve been the
result of something else than the years in prison. But if he was a replica, it
would be compulsory for everyone to try to apprehend him and shut him down on
the spot for public safety. It’d break Braxon to lose his father again. No one
had the right to do that to him, no matter what. And all this—Cynd looked up
at the detective—could be a trap. They might not have Mikke’s and Jot’s confession
at all. Or they could’ve been tortured to admit they weren’t real.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The detective got impatient.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well?’ she asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I really don’t know.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">She slammed the file closed in her hand.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’re not too bright, are we?’ she said, and stood up. ‘Have a nice time in
the can.’</p>



<a name="b2c6"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book2.gif" class="img2"/></p><h1>Chapter 6</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Robots, carbon-based soft creatures, as well as abstract beings in the Universe
have all realised the importance of separating perpetrators of crimes from their
victims. There were two basic ways of achieving this: one was to lock up the
criminals, as most of the civilisations this side of the Great Void did; the
other was to lock up the victims, which was how an infamous abstract society
worked that inhabited a hardly accessible nook of the Standard Model of Particle
Physics. (Everyone considered their legal system to be superior, but, in fact,
it’d been very long since anyone had heard about them.) Anyhow, 
 the planet the Washers and Friers lived on
  happened to fall in the first group, which meant that they had to take the extra
trouble of hunting down murderers and the like instead of simply putting the
robbed, the wounded, and the corpses inside.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Having realised their mistake, the robots attempted to make up for it by deciding
that prisoners should not be guarded. On the contrary, they’d turn them into
guards, each overlooking a little tin box that housed a labyrinth with a myriad
of holes and a tiny stainless steel marble. The inmates were quick to appreciate
the utmost importance of continuously balancing this trinket once they realised
that a clever little mechanism cut their own power supply as soon as the marble
fell through a hole. There was an upside, though, as navigating the marble to
the centre of the labyrinth would have earned their freedom, but no one was known
to have been able to pull off that feat since the beginning of times. On the
contrary, more than one inmate had lost their marbles during trying.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Suspended in limbo between mortal danger and the promise of liberty, the inmates
spent their time sitting on the ground tilting, tapping, whispering at or cursing
and kicking their tiny tin boxes. That, and praying (mostly in the hope that
it would help moving that rotten marble in the right direction).</p>

<p class="pnorm">The 
 prison chaplain
  gathered her flock four times a week, and held services to worship one of the
four main deities. The most important was, of course, the first mass of the week,
dedicated to Ingwyne, the god of water and pay cheques. It was followed by one
in which they focused on his main enemy, Sinmara, the goddess of fire; then they
continued with the netherworld by praying for deliverance from her ally, a giant
serpent lurking in the depths of the Great Void that fed on spaceships trying
to cross to the other side, tempting both Fate and Gravity.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The week finished with a service for Freydy, Ingwyne’s lesser partner, the god
of casual dress and fertility. He was considered a fickle ally, and it was foretold
that their separation would allow Sinmara to rise and start a full-scale war
in which the world would be engulfed in flames and kirsch before being used to
decorate a colossal cupcake. According to a codex, the end of the world, also
known as Weekrökr, was to occur on the next <i>Monday,</i> but no one was
sure what that meant.</p>

<p class="pnorm">During the first hundred hours, 
 Cynd
  had a pretty uneventful time 
 in prison.
  He’d been navigating his marble without letting it drop through a hole, and
was waiting patiently for the developments in his case, when, just as the clock
struck the beginning of the week, he heard 
 Nida’s
  voice coming from the entrance.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m here to visit my son,’ she said, ‘but if he’s far from the gate, that’s
fine. I don’t have time to wait.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">It took an hour to move, inch by inch, to the gate with the tin box, so visitors
usually had to wait quite a lot to see their loved ones as there was no way to
make an appointment in advance. Cynd’s heart sank at the thought that Nida didn’t
want to see him, but had to stay focused. This was becoming more and more difficult;
he’d begun to feel extremely bored with the infantile steel ball that demanded
constant attention, and slightly shook the box in impotent anger, when his view
of the stars was suddenly blocked by a colossal machinery.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Looking up, he recognised one of the janitors who worked the prison. He’d seen
him once or twice, and noticed that he was rather inexperienced with the broom
and the magnets. The janitor walked up to him, puffing and blowing, and said,
in a familiar brassy voice,</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m glad you’re here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The voice belonged to 
Mikke.
  Cynd couldn’t believe his ears. The former Chancellor’s limbs were thick and
out of proportion, and the plates outside scarcely covered the work of shafts
and gears that moved the bulging and oversized torso. Screws, bolts and nuts
kept falling out of his body, one or two with every resounding step, starting
from somewhere inside and clinking their way down just like in a pinball machine.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What are you doing here?’ Cynd asked in astonishment.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What better place for someone on the run than in jail?’ Mikke replied, smiling.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hope they don’t find out,’ Cynd said, and looked down at his tin box again.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They won’t. Listen, Nida was here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, I heard.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And,’ Mikke continued, lowering his voice to a whisper, ‘I think she did something
to the legs.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The legs?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Haven’t you heard? They kept coming here after they brought you in.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s not good.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So what did mum do?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t know. But a minute after she’d left, the legs turned and walked away.
I don’t think anyone would suspect her, though. It must’ve been a small magnet
to disorient the compass of the legs. Or some other ingenious piece of engineering.
She’s a clever cookie, isn’t she?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes,’ Cynd said with a faint smile, ‘she is.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Mikke
  continued to visit 
 Cynd
  whenever he could get near him without attracting suspicion, and kept him up-to-date
with the latest developments. He’d already told him what had happened before
Mrs Gridhur herself came to escort Cynd out of the prison and tell him he was
free to go.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hey,’ Mikke whispered excitedly about an hour before Gridhur appeared. ‘I think
they want to let you out.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘For <i>some</i> reason,’ he drawled, ‘the legs stopped coming here. They’ve
been going to the Forum now. They keep escaping from the morgue, go there, and
simply stand in the middle of the square.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Probably,’ Mikke went on, ‘the police realised they’d no longer be able to convince
a jury that the legs know what they’re doing. And that means the legs’ testimony
against you got weakened to the point that it simply went out of the window.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida
  was waiting for 
 Cynd
  at the 
 entrance,
  who couldn’t be happier to finally leave his tin box behind.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thanks,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida glared at him with murderous eyes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘…for waiting for me.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes,’ Nida said after a second, almost shouting, ‘I heard they were going to
let you go, so where else could a mother be? I took some time off and came here
as fast as I could.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">After they’d got 
 home,
  she became a bit more talkative.</p>

<p class="pnorm">She sat down on the sofa and leaned back. ‘Whew. That was close.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thanks anyway.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t mention it. And keep your mouth shut.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Is it OK to… here?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida nodded. ‘I checked the house, and there are some messengers crawling around
looking for bugs.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So what did you do?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, when the legs followed you to the prison, I immediately knew they weren’t
suggesting that you were the murderer. If they had, there wouldn’t have been
anything else to do once you were inside. I think some in the police started
to have doubts, too, but they were probably going to explain it away by saying
that the legs had no idea the police had got the message, and that where you
were was a prison. So I started thinking about why the legs kept following you.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I knew the only thing that kept them moving was the vegetative system. Now the
primary goal of that system is survival. It knows nothing about revenge or justice
or anything. That means the only reason why they wanted you—was to get help.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Wow. Somehow it makes sense.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They probably sensed that something like this had happened before, and that
you were able to help the body survive.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So why don’t we simply tell the police all this?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida looked at Cynd. ‘Who on earth would believe this? It’d be dismissed as a
desperate attempt to show that the legs of one of the highest-ranking robots
in this country are as dumb as a toaster.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But I thought if the legs only wanted to get help, all I needed to do was to
tell them that you were somewhere else, and they would have no reason not to believe me.
So I told them they could find you around
the Forum on your way to the Academy.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And what happened?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They thanked me and walked away.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How did you talk to them?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t think we need to go into details. We’re not over this yet. It wouldn’t
look good if you knew too much about post-mortem life.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So that’s it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, not really.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We can’t let the legs go around as they please. They’ll figure out you’re not
at the Forum after all, and the whole thing will start over again.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I didn’t have much time to talk to them, so all I could do was to get them away
from the prison. My plan is to catch them when they get from the morgue to the
Forum the next time, and reprogram them to stay put at last.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s a good idea. But I’ll do it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t think so.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why would it be better for you to get caught reprogramming the legs than me?
If I get caught, I’ll go back to prison. If you get caught, we’ll both go.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And I’d be just sitting here and wait? No way.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’ve risked a lot already. And it’s my fault. If I’d been more careful with
the joint…’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘If! And if I hadn’t given you that advice at the Memory House. We’re in this
together. I know how to do it, and you don’t. There’s no need to play the hero
now,’ Nida raised her hand as Cynd opened his mouth to say something. ‘We’ll
do it together. It’ll be much quicker, and you can keep watch.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">As the 
 legs
  had stopped providing useful information to the police, they simply let them
sneak out of the morgue. They knew where they were going. Then, after about two
hours, a patrol would be sent after them, who’d collect the legs in the Forum,
and drop them off where they belonged. This gave ample opportunity for 
 Nida and Cynd
  to try to drag the legs to a dimly lit alley and do with it what they wanted.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida assumed that the legs were rather simple and therefore chose the shortest
route to their destination. Having spent some time over a map of the city, she
and Cynd found a street the legs would definitely have to walk down. And there
was a short blind alley nearby, which was just perfect for the plan. But when
they got there, there was no sign of the legs.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How do we know if they’ve left the morgue at all?’ whispered Cynd.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We don’t. We’ll have to wait a bit.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So what do we do? Sit on the curb or stand in a doorway?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Heavens, no. Nothing would be more suspicious. Keep walking, but let’s keep
an eye on the entrance of the street.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">They were walking up and down, trying to attract as little suspicion as possible.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was apparent that they were close to the centre, because the houses were built
closer to each other than in the outskirts of the city, near the mountains. Some
were multi-storey constructions surreptitiously trying to pass the aluminium
pipes decorating their entrances for stately columns, but the uniform grey dust
made everything look more or less the same.
  Nida and Cynd waited for more than one and a half hours, but the legs were still
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Maybe they took another route,’ Cynd said, but Nida remained silent. ‘That’s
what must’ve happened,’ he went on. ‘Let’s come back at another time.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No,’ Nida said, looking straight ahead. ‘They must come this way.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh,’ sighed Cynd in desperation, and looked up at the sky.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He didn’t believe his eyes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Hardly visibly, just above the horizon, there was an elongated patch of feeble
light. It was too weak to make the sky less black elsewhere, let alone disperse
the pitch-black darkness that constantly surrounded them, but it was undeniably
there.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Look!’ he said to Nida, still looking at the sky, searching for his mother with
his hand.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The legs are here,’ Nida hissed between her teeth. ‘Let’s go.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">And indeed, there were the legs turning into the street where it led into an
avenue. It was quite far from them, and pretty close to the alley, so they had
to walk fast to intercept it before it passed the corner.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They were almost halfway there when Nida stopped.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What?’ whispered Cynd, but there was no need for an answer.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Something that looked like a giant turned into the street after the legs. It
caught up with the half-robot in two long strides, lifted the legs up in the
air, and disappeared into the alley.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida started running after it.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Stop! What are you doing?’ shouted Cynd.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I want to know who that is. I want to know who’s behind this thing!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd rushed after her. He didn’t want her to face that robot alone. As they stepped
into the alley, they saw the legs spread out on the mud with the giant crouching
over them. It had already removed the covers that protected their circuits, and
as soon as it heard Nida and Cynd approaching, it looked up. It had a pair of
V3 eyes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hello, Mikke,’ Cynd said. ‘Long time no see.’</p>



<a name="b2c7"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book2.gif" class="img2"/></p><h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">‘Is that you, 
 Mikke?’
  Nida
  asked in astonishment.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes,’ Mikke blurted as he turned back to the legs in the 
 alley,
  and attached a keyboard to the groin.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But what are you doing?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Trying to fix what you screwed up,’ he said reproachfully, typing frantically
at the keyboard. ‘Where did you store the coordinates?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What did we screw up?’ 
 Cynd
  asked threateningly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, wasn’t it a swell idea to reprogram the legs to get 
 Cynd
  off the hook?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I didn’t touch the legs,’ 
 Nida
  remarked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, sure. And you want me to believe they just happened to start going to the
Forum on their own. Now tell me where you put the coordinates.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Mikke, we’re in this together. What’s the matter? Why is it a problem that the
legs go to the Forum?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, we <i>were</i> in this together. Now, thanks to you, everyone thinks
Aved wants to communicate that he was killed for the country. That is, he’s a
victim of an ongoing <i>coup d’état,</i> prepared by none others than the
newcomers. Brilliant plan!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Is that what they say?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Ah, finally. The coordinates.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Let me explain.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">But Mikke didn’t pay any attention to her. ‘So where should these suckers go?’
he asked himself musingly as he entered long numbers. ‘Somewhere far, far away.’
He finished typing, and disconnected the keyboard. He stood up with difficulty,
and turned to face Nida.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’re a mother,’ he said, ‘and you’ll obviously do everything for Cynd. I thought
we could see each other through until the end of the investigation, but, obviously,
we won’t. Good luck.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He flicked a tiny switch, and the legs started to twitch, banging themselves
against the stone wall lining the alley as they tried to stand up. The three
looked at them with a mixture of fear and hatred. After some struggle, the legs
stood upright. They took two hesitant steps toward the back of the alley, then
turned around, and stood behind Mikke.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What?’ Mikke said. ‘Go on, go where I told you to.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The legs didn’t move.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Go!’ Mikke kicked the legs in the shin.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The legs swayed, but regained their balance, and didn’t seem willing to move.
Mikke took a step forward. The legs took a step, too. Mikke turned and walked
back. The legs followed him wherever he went.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It must’ve been a security code. It’s your work! Come and help me change it
before the police start looking for them!’ shouted Mikke, now visibly trembling
with fear.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I tell you I didn’t change anything in the legs,’ protested Nida, ‘but you’re
right, let’s take a look at it together.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mikke was looking over her shoulder toward the street. He froze.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Everything OK?’ asked Nida uncertainly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s the 
 police,’
  he said under his breath. ‘I need to get out of here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Before any of them could’ve replied, he pushed Nida out of the way, and rushed
out of the alley.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Wait! The legs!’ shouted Nida as she tried to grab the remains of Councillor
Hhan, but Cynd pushed her against the wall to get her out of sight. Mikke had
already disappeared around the corner, and they could hear the rhythmic clangs
of the legs plodding after him.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We have ourselves to think of,’ whispered Cynd, and he flattened himself against
the wall as well.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They waited for the two cops to pass the alley. Cynd wasn’t sure if they recognised
Mikke.</p>

<p class="pnorm">When they were gone, Cynd looked at his mother. There was a blue spark rolling
down her cheek.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘One by one,’ she said, ‘we lose everyone.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Cynd
  had to force himself to go to the 
 Academy—there
  really seemed to be no point. The deputy headmaster was still trying to figure
out what to do, as without Aved’s speeches, half of the curriculum was gone.
Consequently, the students had a lot of free time on their hands. </p>

<p class="pnorm">During the lengthy breaks they amused themselves by taking turns standing on
a barrel in the 
 courtyard
  and delivering speeches mocking the sermons of the late Councillor. The strangest
one, which actually earned a round of applause, was the one spoken backwards—and,
perhaps by coincidence, it was also the one that most closely resembled Aved’s
convoluted rhetoric.</p>

<p class="pnorm">And then, 
 Braxon
  took the stand.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was clear he’d hardly charged himself during the last week. He was barely
able to stand; his oversized eyes kept switching off, and his spoke slowly, slurring
his words.
 Still, a few seconds after he’d started to speak, silence fell on
the court.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hi,’ he began, ‘I’m sorry for interrupting the fun, but I’ve got something to
tell you about that I think affects most of us. As you probably know, some of
us, either through our families or other means,’ he glanced at Cynd, ‘are related
to the four ex-prisoners now usually called “the newcomers.” You may know that
they are generally accused of somehow murdering or helping the murder of Councillor
Aved Hhan. And you might already know that Cynd Washer was already arrested and
then released, and that only a couple of hours ago they’ve arrested my father,
the ex-chancellor, who has always worked for the good of the country.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m not sure how much you know about the details of all this, but as we’re on
the verge of letting a great injustice to be done, I must tell you all I know.
Cynd was arrested because Aved’s legs started to follow him, which was interpreted
as Aved accusing him of murdering him. Then he was let out when the legs suddenly
decided to follow my father instead. Now, as for me, I think this change was
not only rather fortunate for Cynd, but also a bit suspicious. And I’m not completely
alone in this.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The High Council also thinks that someone has tampered with the legs, and it
is not Aved that accuses my father.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The Council,’ said Cynd aloud, in a throaty voice, ‘is your mother, right?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Braxon turned his head toward him, but didn’t reply.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He continued, ‘The police are also looking into the matter. And I’m sure we can
help them. We must prevent this miscarriage of justice to blemish the face of
our great country!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was a cautious cheering among the students.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I accuse—I accuse Cynd Washer of somehow modifying the legs or having them
modified, and I accuse anyone who cooperates with him of complicity. I know justice
can be done.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m waiting.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Dul’s
  voice could be heard shouting, ‘For all he’s done for you, <i>my</i> father
deserves justice to be done!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The students whirled around to capture, restrain, interrogate, deliver to the
authorities or simply lynch the rightly accused and wrongly released Cynd Washer.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But he was no longer there.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He’d sneaked out as soon as he’d realised where Braxon’s speech had been going.
Crushed and hardly able to walk, he forced himself to climb over the gates of
the courtyard while the rusty building of the Academy echoed the war cry of Dul.
He was running again, now from the Academy back home, turning back from time
to time to see if he was followed. Maybe Braxon and the rest didn’t dare to leave
the Academy. Or maybe they were already on his trail, scouring the streets of
the city, working up everyone against him. He must warn Nida.</p>

<p class="pnorm">When he got to 
 their house,
  it was already deserted; only a faithful, lonely messenger was there, curled
up on the doorstep. It jumped up and ran to Cynd as soon as it heard its owner
coming. It was already climbing up his leg when Cynd reached down and carefully
picked it up.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was a message from Nida. It said:</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hi Cynd dear, it’s mum. I’m with the police now, but <i>don’t</i> worry, sweetheart,
they only asked me to help them. Apparently I’m the best engineer or something,’
she giggled. ‘Everything will be fine; you just <i>go</i> and get something
to eat, OK? I’m sorry but there’s not a thing <i>in the house.</i> And try
to <i>leave</i> something <i>for</i> me, too. Take care until mummy gets
home, and be a <i>good</i> boy, OK, sweetie? Lots of love.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">That was the end of the message. Cynd held the messenger between two fingers,
holding it at a distance from himself. The whole thing sounded so strange and
childish. Then, as if struck by a lightning, he felt a surge of panic. Deep down,
one of his vegetative processors realised what the message meant. All he knew
was that he had to get away from the house, but he didn’t dare to run. And he
had nowhere to go.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He tried to get out of the part of the city he was usually found in as fast as
possible. He knew he couldn’t leave the capital, not without a car. There were
no chargers along the roads. But what could he possibly do inside the city? It
would only be a question of time for a spy messenger to find him. He could try
disguising himself as a lamppost or a fence, and vegetate for a couple of decades,
completely isolated. No one would even notice if he died.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It was an accident,’ he kept saying to himself, ‘and if it’s anyone’s fault,
it’s Mikke’s. No one asked him to bring that damn messenger here.’ What was he
supposed to do with that messenger anyway? Should he have left it at home and
make them suspect Nida of being a Frier when they find it? Of course he was gonna
keep it on himself. They must’ve seen it at the Academy. And then Aved and his
paranoia about the newcomers. It was an accident.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The voices in his head died away. He knew all too well that the fact that it
was an accident was neither here nor there.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Shit happens,’ he concluded, and looked up. 
 The dingy, tent-like houses looked strange. And the narrow road that meandered
between them looked unfamiliar, too.
  That was good. On the one hand, it didn’t really matter. And on the other, how
would anyone find him if he himself didn’t know where he was?</p>

<p class="pnorm">He smiled and stretched out his arms. He felt at one with 
 the timeless, perpetual night that surrounded him and the street. The empty triangular
houses—half-submerged in the grey swamp of dust that felt deeper than elsewhere—looked
like indifferent, but familiar faces. He wondered if there was anyone living
in them. He could see a couple of footprints and tracks leading up to them, but
it was impossible to tell when they were made.
He was getting closer to the cliffs that loomed around the city. Maybe he could
get to the mountains, after all. Why not? There might be an abandoned building
somewhere among the rocks with electricity.
  That would be nice. He smiled. He was free. He was alone. Until, that is, he
heard some noise coming from behind him. It was someone running, but on the verge
of exhaustion.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He turned around.</p>

<p class="pnorm">That someone was 
 Braxon.
  Cynd
  quickly looked around searching for a suitable place to hide. There seemed to
be no one else coming. Braxon was getting nearer and nearer, and then, just as
Cynd took a step toward a house the door of which was left half-open, he suddenly
stopped.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He saw Cynd.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Is that you?’ he asked in a squeaky voice.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes,’ Cynd said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Please don’t go away.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m not going away.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Braxon walked up to him in quick, tiny steps, like an oversized and frightened
messenger robot.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hi,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hi,’ Cynd said, and crossed his arms.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Look, I’m so sorry for, you know. They took dad, and…’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He didn’t finish the sentence.</p>

<p class="pnorm">After a pause, Cynd said, ‘They took me as well.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, I know, I know, but you see why I thought you had something to do with…’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was another awkward pause.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, I’m so glad to hear that. Look, I’ve managed to explain things away at the
Academy. Everything’s fine.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That was nice of you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I know it was all my fault, but it’s OK now.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m sure it is.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Braxon looked away, and then looked at Cynd again.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘All I wanted to say is that I’m sorry.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s OK.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Do you think we could be together again?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We weren’t really together very much to begin with.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But I think we were, very much. Could we just continue,’ he chirped, more and
more rapidly, ‘where we left off? This incident forced me to realise how much
I’m attached to you. No, how much I love you, Cynd. Can I—Can I log into you?
Like in the old times?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd just stood there, thunderstruck.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He looked into Braxon’s pleading eyes. He didn’t raise his voice. He simply said,
‘You must be out of your fucking mind.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Braxon gasped, and went to pieces.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I knew it!’ he shrieked. ‘I knew it all along! It’s Adda, isn’t it? You’re a
Frier just like that bitch! You know what, I don’t care if they shut you down
for good. In fact, I think I’ll rather enjoy watching it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He turned and strode back the way he’d come.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd was picked up by the police about an hour later. They said they knew about
the ‘other’ messenger. He didn’t put up a fight. He simply surrendered himself,
without any resistance.</p>



<a name="b2c8"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book2.gif" class="img2"/></p><h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">It was the most important criminal trial in the history of the new country, and
its significance was not lost on its inhabitants. So many robots tried to squeeze
into the only courtroom of the capital that the Court had to move to the 
 Memory House
  instead. As the raised chancel was wider than the front of the courtroom, Mrs
 Beetemle
  decided to have the exhibits arranged in a row there instead of along the wall
which was the custom for criminal proceedings. And so the exhibits were pushed
in, one by one, in wheeled glass cases. First, 
 Aved’s
  legs arrived, swaying to and fro behind the glass in an apparently cheerful
manner, then the screwdriver Cynd had used at the time of the accident, followed
by, in larger cabinets, the defendants, 
 Nida,
  Cynd,
  and finally, in a specially strengthened container, 
 Mikke.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Beetemle, the only whole Councillor, presided over the Court, with Mrs 
 Gridhur
  representing the state from behind a tiny desk. A blackboard had been placed
between Mrs Gridhur and the raised table of the judge. The auditorium was quickly
filled up; robots lined the aisles, and some even sat on the chancel.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘If the Court please,’ Mrs Gridhur raised to speak after Mrs Beetemle’s introduction,
‘the prosecution will withhold their statement until after the testimonies have
been heard.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Very well,’ said Mrs Beetemle.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you, Ma’am,’ Mrs Gridhur said, bowed, and then proceeded to squeeze herself
between the desk and the chair again.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Beetemle said, ‘The usher will call the witnesses now. Mrs Gridhur and the
three defendants, who have been entered into evidence as Exhibits A, B and C,
are all familiar with the rules.’ She looked around inquisitively. They all nodded.
She continued, ‘You mustn’t interrupt the spontaneous part of the witnesses’
response. They have exactly 2 minutes to relate whatever they think is important
about the case. After that, the prosecution and the defendants are free to ask
them questions, but must refrain from directly countering or simply refuting
their claims. Any questions?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No,’ they all replied together.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Dul
  Hhan,’ the usher called.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Dul stood up from his seat in the auditorium, and made his way up to the blackboard.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, Dul,’ Mrs 
 Beetemle
  said, ‘tell me all you know about the case. There’s some chalk if you’d like
to write or draw us something.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you; I think I’ll be fine,’ Dul said, and turned toward the audience.
He said, in so many words, that it was his conviction that Cynd was, at least
in part, responsible for his father’s death, and that he based that conclusion
on how the legs of his father kept following Cynd. He also related, with hardly
hidden pride, how he alerted the police when he spotted the legs at Cynd’s house.</p>

<p class="pnorm">When he finished, Mrs Gridhur put up her hand.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes,’ Mrs Beetemle said, motioning her to speak.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Dul,’ Mrs Gridhur said, standing up with difficulty, ‘was and is the behaviour
of the legs in accordance with that of your father?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No more questions,’ Mrs Gridhur announced.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Beetemle looked at the three defendants. Cynd put up his hand.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Had the late Councillor,’ he asked, ‘ever been to that part of the city where
our house is?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘He oversaw the construction of this city,’ Dul replied. ‘I’m sure he was.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">A soft titter rippled through the hall.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘As far as you know,’ Cynd continued calmly, ‘did he visit that area during the
last two years?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Dul remained silent.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You need to answer the question,’ Mrs Beetemle reminded him, ‘and you need to
give the correct and true answer.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No,’ Dul said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s all,’ Cynd said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Dul,’ Nida said, when it was her turn, ‘I think we can safely assume that the
legs wanted to achieve something by following Cynd. I’m sure we all know that
Cynd, with some engineering work, had helped Councillor Aved Hhan to grow. Is
it possible that they wanted to ask him for help?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They could’ve gone to the People’s Smith for that. I’m sure my father figured
out what caused the accident.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Perhaps it would be blasphemous to assume,’ Nida remarked, ‘that the legs were,
or are in possession of the full mental capacity of the late Councillor.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The laughter was now clearly audible in the hall.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I have no further questions,’ Nida said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I have no questions, Ma’am,’ Mikke said when Mrs Beetemle, smiling, turned to
him.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Braxon
  was called next. He looked nervous and tired; his left eye went blank for seconds
on end, but his voice sounded firm and strong. He described how his father disappeared
right after the murder, and how he met him again after Cynd had been released.
He said Mikke was worried about how it would be interpreted that the legs had
started to go to the Forum, and that he personally was convinced that someone
had tampered with the legs to help Cynd, and shift suspicion to his father.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It is wrong to think,’ he declared, ‘that the newcomers were at odds with the
High Council. I was there during many of the arguments my mother and my father
had, and I can tell you that they basically agreed&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You only have half a minute left,’ Mrs Beetemle said loudly, with a trace of
panic in her voice.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Braxon looked at her, and continued after a second. ‘I guess what I’m trying
to say is that the newcomers have nothing to do with it. I accuse…’ His
voice broke. ‘I accuse Cynd Washer. I know he received a direct message from
Adda Frier in which he was instructed to convince Councillor Aved Hhan to grow
so large that he’d break into pieces. He’s the one responsible for botslaughter!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you, Braxon,’ Mrs Beetemle said, still a little more loudly than necessary.
‘Any questions?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Gridhur raised.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I have a copy of that other message here which I wish to enter into evidence
as Exhibit F.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you, Mrs Gridhur. Are there any objections?’ Mrs Beetemle asked. No one
answered. She continued, ‘Please proceed.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Gridhur handed over a messenger, and turned to Braxon. ‘Can you tell us how
you got hold of this message?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes,’ Braxon said, with a rehearsed calmness, ‘I found it on the floor of a
cottage next to the Academy.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What did you use this cottage for?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We usually met there, Dul and Cynd and I.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Did you meet Cynd there before you found the message?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Was Dul or anyone else there?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And what did you do?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We made love to each other.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I have no further questions.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Braxon,’ Nida said, very calmly, ‘What did you do with the messenger you found?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I connected to it and copied it,’ Braxon said. ‘I didn’t want Cynd to notice
that it was missing.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Was it before or after Cynd was arrested?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Before.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You know, right, that we and our house were searched just before the arrest,
and that they only found one message, the one about Elb’s burial, which the Court
is already familiar with?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh,’ Braxon said, ‘I… I was wrong. I actually took the messenger. I only
wanted to copy it, but then I thought it’d be better to have the original.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Do you have the original with you?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, I don’t.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Where is it?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I gave it to Mrs Gridhur.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Is it the one she’s just introduced into evidence?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, yes, that’s the one.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But Mrs Gridhur has just said it was a copy.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh what difference does that make! It was Cynd! It was him, not dad!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Without waiting for the judge’s permission, Cynd asked a single question. ‘Do
you love me, Braxon?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No!’ he howled. ‘I hate you! I hate you even more than how I loved you before!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you, Braxon,’ Mrs Beetemle said, and wiped her oily forehead.</p>

<p class="pnorm">A murmur rose in the hall as Braxon stepped down, which grew as the usher walked
up to Mrs Beetemle to discuss something. But it stopped in an instant when he
turned to call the next witness: Jot Nifli.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Jot
  was surrounded by stunned silence as he stood up and walked up to the stand.
It was only then that the robots in the audience realised that he wasn’t among
the defendants.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Ma’am,’ he began, turning to Mrs Beetemle, ‘Mrs Gridhur asked me to come here,
but I don’t know anything about this matter apart from what’s been reported in
the news.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Beetemle turned to Mrs Gridhur. ‘Perhaps the prosecution can explain.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘With the Court’s permission,’ said Mrs Gridhur, ‘I would like to ask Mr Nifli
some questions.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We will make an exception and skip the spontaneous account, as the witness has
admitted that he is unfamiliar with the case before the Court. Please proceed,
Mrs Gridhur.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Mr Nifli,’ Gridhur turned to the newcomer, ‘Are you aware that there is a restraining
order in effect prohibiting you from going within a five-mile radius of the Academy?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, I am.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘When was this order imposed?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Shortly after I started to tour the country with Mikke Beetemle.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Have you breached this order or visited the Academy since then?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Were you arrested by the police for breaching this order?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Do you know why?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I was told Cynd Washer had implied that I met Aved Hhan in the Academy.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you; I have no further questions.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Just a minute,’ interposed Mrs Beetemle, ‘I have a couple of questions to ask.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Rather unusual,’ sneered Mrs Gridhur, ‘for Ma’am to question the witness before
the defendants do.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The prosecution will correct me if I’m mistaken,’ retorted Mrs Beetemle, ‘but
this variation of court procedure is certainly allowed within the limits set
out in law.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It is, Ma’am.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you, Mrs Gridhur. Mr Nifli, do you know what Cynd said that led to your
arrest?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I was given a copy of that part of his testimony.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Would you read it out aloud to the Court, please.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">It took a second or two for Nifli to load the excerpt.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Mrs Gridhur asked, “Did he visit the Academy?” meaning me. Cynd: “He might’ve.”
Then later Mrs Gridhur asked, “Did he meet Aved?” and Cynd replied, “He might’ve,
if he went to the Academy.”&nbsp;’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Is that all?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No. Mrs Gridhur later asked again if I’d met Aved, to which Cynd replied, I
quote, “I’m not sure, but I had the impression that he had.”&nbsp;’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Was it the first time in Cynd’s life that he was interviewed by the police?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I think so, yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Was he under emotional stress?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m sure I don’t know,’ said Nifli with open hostility.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’ll rephrase the question. Is it possible that he was under emotional stress?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Of course. Everything’s possible.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘One last question. The sentences of defendant A, are they positive statements
or guesswork on the defendant’s part?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They’re not positive statements.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s all from me. Do the defendants wish to ask questions?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">All three said no.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘In that case,’ Mrs Beetemle said, ‘You’ll be excused, Mr Nifli.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Nifli left the chancel and sat down. Mrs Beetemle went on.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Your attention please! Mr Jot Nifli was the last witness in this case. In terms
of evaluation, I think they all did pretty well, but there’s still room for improvement.
I won’t mark their performance this time, but I think this has been very useful,
and we can all learn from their mistakes. Now, Mrs Gridhur, does the prosecution
wish to make their statement?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘In fact, I think, Ma’am, that now we all have a general impression as to what
might’ve happened, so I’d like to proceed with the closing argument. What I’d
like to prove&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘If you’d like to come to the blackboard, please.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Certainly,’ Mrs Gridhur said, stood in front of the blackboard, and took a piece
of chalk.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So, what do you want to prove?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’d like to prove that Cynd Washer, Mikke Beetemle with the help of Nida Washer
are guilty of the murder of Councillor Aved Hhan. I intend to show this beyond
all reasonable doubt.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Go on.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So, if <i>M</i> is for murder, and <i>D</i> represents exhibit D, the victim, then we know
the murder destroys the victim, that is,</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘(1) <i>M+D = 0</i>,’ which she wrote on the blackboard.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What I’d like to show is that exhibit A, Cynd Washer, and exhibit C, Mikke Beetemle,
with the aid of exhibit B, Nida Washer, committed the murder:</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘(2) <i>A·C+B = M</i>.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘In order to prove this, let us suppose that (2) is true.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Now, subtracting <i>D</i> from both sides of (1) we get</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘(3) <i>M = –D</i>,</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘and by combining (2) and (3) we get</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘(4) <i>A·C+B = M = –D</i>,</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘that is,</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘(5) <i>A·C+B = –D</i>.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Subtracting <i>B</i> from (5) we get</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘(6) <i>A·C = –D–B</i>,</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘and if we go back to equation (2) and subtract <i>B</i> from both sides we arrive at</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘(7) <i>A·C = M–B</i>.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Let’s combine (6) and (7), and we see that</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘(8) <i>M–B = A·C = –D–B</i>,</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘in other words,</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘(9) <i>M–B = –D–B</i>,</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘from which, by adding <i>B</i>, we get</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘(10) <i>M = –D</i></p>

<p class="pnorm">‘and by adding <i>D</i> to both sides:</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘(11) <i>M+D = 0</i>,</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘which is the same as (1), and therefore it is true. Thus the supposition is
true, and the defendants are guilty.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The proof earned a warm round of applause. Not everyone followed it in detail,
but the equations certainly looked very impressive on the blackboard. Mrs Beetemle,
resting her head on her left palm, squinted her eyes as she looked at the proof.
She didn’t see Nida putting up her hand.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But,’ Mrs Beetemle said finally, ‘but I don’t think you can prove something
by presupposing what you want to prove, and then concluding that it implies something
that’s true.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why not?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What you need to do is to presuppose the opposite of what you want to prove,
and show that it leads to contradiction.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I know, Ma’am, what an indirect proof is,’ replied Mrs Gridhur, ‘but that doesn’t
show that this method is faulty.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, it doesn’t, but let’s apply your method to a false proposition. Say, I want
to prove that Aved Hhan never existed.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘A rather strange proposition, Ma’am.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I merely wanted to choose one that’s clearly false.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, it is.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you. Now, let’s suppose that the proposition is true, that is, Aved Hhan
doesn’t exist. It follows, doesn’t it, that his head doesn’t exist, and that
implies that his head cannot be in this hall.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Which is true, so the proposition is true, and the victim doesn’t exist. We
can all go home.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was a tense silence as everyone looked at Mrs Gridhur.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I see,’ Mrs Gridhur said at last.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I move,’ said Nida quickly, ‘that the case should be dismissed since the prosecution
is apparently unable to prove the guilt of the defendants beyond all reasonable
doubt.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m sorry,’ said Mrs Beetemle, ‘but once a court takes on a problem, it has
to be proven either that the defendants are guilty, or that they are not guilty,
or that it cannot be proven that they are guilty or not guilty. Would the defence
care to make a statement?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mikke
  put up his hand. ‘Can I try?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Certainly,’ Mrs Beetemle beckoned him. ‘Come here to the blackboard.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mikke carefully opened the door of the glass case, climbed down, and slowly walked
around the large table. The concrete made cracking noises under his enormous
feet, and his joints creaked under his own weight. He stopped before the blackboard,
and blinked. Cynd looked there. Somehow the blackboard looked less black than
it used to, and the chalk marks were almost glowing in the semi-darkness. Mikke
looked around uncertainly, and stretched out his arm to pick up a piece of chalk
with fingers that resembled metal tentacles with a dozen joints.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I think the opposite is true,’ his voice boomed. ‘What I’ll attempt to prove
is that we are innocent. The first step will be to prove that Nida and Cynd Washer
are innocent. Let us rank all robots according to their guilt or innocence in
this case. So who’s number 0, the most guilty one?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t know,’ Mrs Beetemle said, ‘isn’t that what we’re trying to find out?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘For the sake of the argument.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Cynd, then,’ interposed Mrs Gridhur.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mikke wrote Cynd’s name next to a big 0 on the blackboard. ‘OK. Who’s number
1?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Nida?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Number 2?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’d be yourself.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Very well. And number 3?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nobody answered.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘In fact,’ Mikke continued in his harsh brass, ‘it doesn’t really matter. It
can be you, Ma’am, or Mrs Gridhur, or Jot Nifli, or&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Jot Nifli,’ said Mrs Beetemle.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, OK. I’ll put that on the board as well. The rest really doesn’t matter;
we can all imagine that we’ve ranked everyone, and then continued with the ones
who passed away, who are probably not too guilty, and then everything including
a sudden fatal thunderbolt, an anti-gravitational spiral luring innocent pedestrians
to certain death, or a toaster with a short, and so on. Basically, we want to
rank everyone and everything in the universe.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Now, even though you’ve selected Cynd, Nida and myself as the guiltiest ones,
as the numbers 0, 1 and 2 are the smallest natural numbers, I’ll show how wrong
you are, as these numbers are, in fact, the largest and most innocent of them
all!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Some weak-nerved ladies in the hall started to fan themselves as their brains
heated up trying to imagine the largest numbers of them all.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The proof is simple. I’ll start with Nida and Cynd, 0 and 1. Now, it’s clear
that no other number can be the greatest, as for any number greater than 1, its
square is greater than the number itself. But this does not hold for 0 and 1,
whose squares are 0 and 1, respectively. Therefore, they must be the greatest
numbers.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">With a theatrical gesture, he crossed out Nida’s and Cynd’s names.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’ll leave it as an exercise for you to prove that number 2 is also greater
than any of the rest of the numbers, which can be done in exactly the same way,’
he continued, and crossed out his own name, too.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I knew it’d come to this,’ someone shouted from the first row. It was 
 Jot
  Nifli. His was the only remaining name on the blackboard. ‘But I won’t take
the rap for Aved’s murder. I don’t have anything to do with this whole thing!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Calm down,’ Mrs Beetemle said, ‘nobody’s accusing you of anything.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The hell they don’t! Look at the blackboard! Your husband has just proved that
zero, one and two are the largest numbers. So which is the smallest and therefore
the guiltiest one? Three. And who’s three? That’s me! But I don’t have a motive.
I never had anything against Aved.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well,’ Mikke said, ‘you did tour the country with me advocating real democracy
and&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s not true!’ said Nifli at the top of his voice. ‘I’ve never said any of
those things. And I took everything back I’d said anyway.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What?’ said Mikke, astounded.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You took back everything?’ Mrs Beetemle asked as if she hadn’t heard.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘When?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘About three hours ago,’ Mrs Gridhur rose to speak, pulling out a piece of paper
from a folder and offering it to Mrs Beetemle with a triumphant grin.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Not that there was anything to retract, really,’ Nifli added quickly. ‘That
I took part in those incentive speeches against the High Council is a lie.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I think,’ Mrs Beetemle said calmly as she took the paper, ‘we all remember what
you two said. And the fact that you’ve withdrawn all the statements you publicly
made appears to corroborate that.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’re all in this together!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Calm down, young man,’ an elderly woman said from somewhere behind him. ‘If
you followed Mr Beetemle’s proof, you can see that he didn’t&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I can see what I can see, thanks a lot, old trot,’ Nifli quipped, but a couple
of robots thought he’d gone too far.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Who do you think you are, insulting an old lady like that?’ said one.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Perhaps you’ll be man enough to apologise!’ said another.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nifli said, ‘I don’t think I need to take this any longer,’ and turned to leave.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Insults showered on him as he tried to sidle his way among the seats to the aisle.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Order! Order!’ the usher and Mrs Beetemle shouted.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Will Mr Jot Nifli please return to his seat, and will everyone keep quiet!’
Mrs Beetemle ordered. ‘I think we need to return to the proof. I don’t think
it’s&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">But Nifli didn’t stop.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Look! He doesn’t obey the judge!’ someone shouted as he got halfway to the exit.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Stop him, stop him for Mumha’s sake,’ cried the old lady, ‘he’s the real Frier
spy!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Pandemonium broke loose in the hall. The robots threw themselves on Nifli, and
quickly pulled him down. Some kicked him, some punched him, some tried to drag
him by the legs back in front of the Court.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Leave him alone!’ Mikke bellowed. ‘He’s innocent! I can vouch for it!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He lunged forward to save Nifli.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Beetemle screamed.</p>

<p class="pnorm">As Mikke jumped down from the edge of the chancel, the leg he landed on could
no longer support the massive weight of his over-enlarged body. With a cracking
noise, the leg folded upon itself, and disappeared under his torso. At the same
time, the momentum of the jump carried him forward, and he crashed onto the concrete
floor with a thunderous noise. His parts flew in every direction with power arcs
dancing between his broken cables.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But nobody paid any attention to him.</p>

<p class="pnorm">For in that exact moment, a ray of sunlight found its way through the open door
into the Memory House.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The feeble light of the rising sun was enough to blind all the inhabitants of
the new country who happened to look in the wrong direction, and melt their eyes
specially adapted to perpetual darkness. Somewhere, in a small village near the
mountains, a young blinded robot was rummaging in his late father’s travelling
chest. Finally he found what he was looking for: the pair of V18 eyes his father
used to wear before everyone moved here. With shaking fingers he disassembled
his face, and popped the eyes in. They worked perfectly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Can you see?’ his partner asked. ‘What is it?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The young robot peeked out of the window. A narrow white crescent of the sun
sparkled majestically above the horizon.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Quick,’ he said, hardly above a whisper. ‘They’re here.’</p>



<a name="b3c1"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book3.gif" class="img3"/></p><h1>Book 3<br/>Chapter 1</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">‘Hurry up,’ 
 Feina
  shouted down the crimson hall towards the dressing room where 
 Adda
  was making her toilet, ‘we’ll be late for the execution.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Letting Mikke, Jot and the other two prisoners out hadn’t exactly gone unnoticed
in the old country, either. The event for which Adda was putting her Sunday best
on was the direct consequence of that.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Isn’t she ready yet?’ 
 Ricco
tutted, posing in his uniform and tube-like necklace filled with quicksilver,
the usual attire of the Chancellor
 on inaugurations, executions, and other formal occasions.
  He had been nominated
Chancellor to replace Mikke Constable, and so the Frier family now occupied the
 Chancellor’s residence on the Filehall.
  He, just like his sister, Feina, had wizened during the years, with his hair
grown coarse like a tangle of black wire.
  Feina herself had aged. Her firm lips had become colourless lines, not unlike
the ones that furrowed the forehead above her sharp eyes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m here,’ Adda said in a fluty voice as she joined them in the reception room
of the Chancellor’s marble and steel residence on the Filehall.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Feina stooped down to kiss her on the cheek. ‘Oh, there’s a little big girl,’
she said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Although Adda was about half as large as when the Washers had left, she was no
longer a child. Her ivory countenance matured into calm beauty; her figure had
been rearranged to have shapely legs, modest curves, and to be generally pleasing
to the eye; and her once restless crystal eyes were warm with a patience that
was forged in some distant and now well-hidden pain. She wore an expensive and
extremely fragile dress made of four panes of silver-plated glass, and a pink
lace cap that used to belong to a Version-Two chancellor’s wife.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How do I look?’ she chirped and turned around, making the mirrors give a tinkling
sound.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’re beautiful,’ Feina smiled.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Nice,’ said Ricco, ‘but what took you that long?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, you have no idea how difficult it is to put this thing on. I accidentally
knocked one of the panes against the bedpost. For a moment I thought it’d cracked.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I could’ve helped you,’ Feina said, still smiling. ‘Or Nanny.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I know I’m not very big, but I think I can put on a dress, thank you. You don’t
have to treat me like a child. You&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Shh,’ 
 Ricco
  hissed. ‘There’s a balloon coming.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Indeed, a small, shiny, rigid beryllium ball floated in the emerald air from
the direction of Power Bridge, chirping indistinctly. These hollow balls that
contained nothing but vacuum had once been popular toys for children. They were
lighter than air, and, tethered on silver strings, they danced beautifully in
the slightest breeze. But the Royal Court and the Royal Secret Service had been
quick to realise the potential of these balloons, and had many of them built
with hooks to carry spy clouds, or with tiny megaphones that announced the latest
orders and decrees to all subjects in the kingdom.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Feina, Ricco and Adda
  turned toward the window, and donned the mask of innocent happiness. Adda wasn’t
entirely sure if this was necessary, as she’d never believed the rumours that
announcement balloons were used by the Royal Secret Service, or, as it had become
to be known, <i>the Service,</i> to spy on people, but they needed to stand
completely still anyway, because it wasn’t easy to make out the words squealed
by the tiny megaphone a couple of miles up in the air.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Feina and Ricco were in deep concentration as they watched the balloon fly towards
them over the glittering palaces and villas that lined the riverbank. People
stopped on the streets as it passed. Cars and buses applied the brakes as gently
as they could so as not to make any noise. A strange silence fell on the otherwise
bustling city.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Declare all…’ Feina said slowly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘By order of the Service,’ Ricco whispered.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The balloon was about to disappear around the corner of the house, and they rushed
to the bronze salon in the opposite wing. The balloon almost reached the Royal
Palace and Screen Park.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Messengers!’ Feina said, hardly believing her ears. ‘&nbsp;“Declare all messengers
by order of the Service.”&nbsp;’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What does that mean?’ Ricco asked, still looking at the balloon, and suddenly
reminding himself to smile.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Milo,’ Feina said, turning away from the window. ‘Milo’s the acting head of
the Service. We should be the first to declare them.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But why now? We’ll be late.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘He’ll be there at the ceremony, too. With about every journalist who can move
in the country. If you give him a chance, he’ll accuse you of hiding something
that made you hesitate to follow such a simple order designed to safeguard national
security.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, how I wish dad hadn’t agreed to promoting him. I don’t think his eyeball
winked twice, anyway. If I was the King&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But you’re not. And the way things are going, Milo will get there first. So
get your hive. Adda, you, too. No, wait, I’ll help you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thanks,’ Adda said wryly. She knew she was too small to carry the messenger
hive. But suddenly, as if struck by a sudden realisation, she whirled around
and started upstairs.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s OK,’ she shouted back in a quivering voice. ‘I’ll manage.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Nonsense,’ Feina said, catching up with her in two easy strides. ‘It’s too heavy.
You’ll bend your new legs.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Most Friers no longer remembered exactly how they had gotten rid of half of the
country, or why, but they generally agreed that there were few things worse or
less desirable in the Universe than the creatures called the Washers. Apart from
that, they could hardly agree on anything. There had been, for example, no one
to run the country for over a year. King Sayn was dead, and Pattero was dead,
and Mr Godnor was, well, Mr Godnor. It’s true that one of Pattero’s eyes was
still working, as well as the King’s navel (Mr Godnor was said to have taken
care of some of the other parts nearby), and, with Kantro’s hand, the three body
parts formed the council called 
 the Elders,
  which was supposed to advise the King, or in its absence, to fill its place.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They enjoyed great popularity, were often referred to as the Great Defeaters
of the Washers and the Defenders of the Frier Homeland, and touching them was
thought to heal various ailments and fix software bugs. Mr Godnor was somewhat
of an inconvenience, especially as three years ago someone had found the Andromedan
white dwarf and the priceless piece of the Great Void on a golden chain, the
Friers’ gift to the royal couple, in the compost pile of the Palace, alongside
a putrid mass of electron shells, broken infinite series with their closed forms
missing, and a large heap of inexpensive interstellar dust—by-products of Mr
Godnor’s many failed computations and experiments. Mr Godnor attributed this
to a mistake, and reduced his public appearances to carrying the heavily decorated
box that contained King Sayn’s navel, and occasionally doing smaller repairs
on the other two Elders.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">‘What do you mean there’s one missing?’ bellowed 
 Ricco
 as a wisp of smoke appeared around his neck, a sign that the heat generated
by his processors experiencing terror and anger had ignited the oil in his spine.
His trembling fingers ran through his hair almost autonomously.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s missing. It’s not there,’ explained 
 Adda
  in a strained voice. ‘There are hundreds of them. I don’t understand what the
fuss is about.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Messengers always come back,’ said 
 Feina
 in an ominous tone.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, one hasn’t. Someone stepped on it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, that happened twice, I think,’ Ricco hissed between his teeth, ‘and then
you whined about them for weeks, until we got them replaced.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, let’s say someone stepped on it anyway.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So it’s not true,’ Feina said, and straightened up. ‘Where is it, then?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why does it matter?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco started to lose his temper. ‘Look, young lady. <i>We</i> really don’t
want to know what happened to that messenger. But, apparently,’ he glanced at
Feina, ‘the Royal Secret Service does. They can track all the new messengers,
and if you happened, just happened to send it to&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They can track the messengers?’ Adda asked taken aback.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No one’s sure,’ said Feina, ‘but why else do you think they insisted on replacing
all of them just after the Battle?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They can either track them down or sniff them out. Maybe they already have,
and this is just a set-up…’ Ricco said as his limbs began to shake under
the weight of the thought.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Talk of Mumha and she’ll appear,’ Feina said in a vain attempt to calm him down
and prevent another of his paranoid outbursts.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They’ll put two and two together,’ he insisted.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What two?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, she,’ he said, pointing at Adda, ‘was among the volunteers who buried
the Washers that died in the Battle.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was a second of silence.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Did you really have to do it?’ he squealed, knowing the answer full well.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We bury the dead,’ Adda countered. ‘That’s what civilisations do.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But Pattero forbade to bury Mumha or Elb. And it was you who buried Elb. Did
you know it was forbidden?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It was a knee-jerk reaction by Pattero, for bissake! They were robots, just
like you or me! And we used to be a civil society who did what was due to the
dead, even to murderers and enemies, since Version One.’ She paused for a second.
‘And if those Washer wretches meant harm, the sooner they were in the junk yard,
the better.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘She might have a point there,’ Ricco admitted after a pause.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes,’ Feina added hotly. ‘From a universal-ethical point of view, looking down
here from a distant planet with a telescope made of misguided love and understanding.
The Service will bring the issue up again to ruin you, and Adda, and me. No one
cares about ethics and morals and what was forbidden then, or what wasn’t. All
they care about is what it looks like now. And it doesn’t look nice. And you,’
she turned to her daughter, ‘can only thank your luck that it’s been fine so
far.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The conviction was gone from Adda’s voice. ‘Do you really think they’d do that?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, I do. With Milo there, I don’t think they’d stop at anything.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I… I sent that one messenger to&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Stop! Don’t tell us. Don’t tell anyone a thing. Let’s take a look at that hive.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Here it is,’ Ricco said, and put it on a glass table with hand-carved crystal
legs. He snapped his fingers, and the messengers swarmed out of the hive, forming
tiny ranks of eight on the slippery surface. In the very last line, there were
only seven messengers. The ones around the gap were shaking visibly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, that’s 1023. We’ll say that you’ve got a 512 hive, and hopefully we’ll
get away with that,’ he said; swept up 511 of the messengers, and crushed them
between his palms.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What are you doing?’ Adda shrieked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Sorry, darling,’ Feina said. ‘We’re trying to survive here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘If anyone asks, you can either deny that you’ve ever had a bigger hive, or admit
that you destroyed some of your messengers,’ Ricco told her. ‘You cannot tell
anyone that it was your mother or me.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes,’ Feina said, bending down her head.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Feina looked at her, and put her arm around her shoulders. ‘It’s going to be
okay.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, mum,’ Feina whispered, and added, ‘I’m sorry.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">The ceremony was to take place in Exe’s 
 Circium
to the north of Power Bridge. The dome-like building was covered both on the
outside and the inside with multi-coloured gems purchased from interplanetary
merchants, which made it sparkle in the constant sunshine like a miniature galaxy.
In order not to disrupt the pattern on its surface with doors and other openings,
they’d built an extremely low entrance one had to crawl through to get in. Once
inside, Adda, as always, was overwhelmed by the carnival of sunbeams that scattered
off the multiple layers of crystals and precious stones. That feeling, however,
quickly gave way to claustrophobia, and a sense that there was no escape from
this prison built of light.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The execution was so high profile that it was by invitation only, but the dome
was still almost full with robots. 
 The Elders
 were there with 
Mr Godnor;
 there were other members of the Court including 
Ricco
  and his family, as well as entrepreneurs, magnates, moguls, film stars, scientists,
and other celebrities.
 Yet Milo, who through hard work and determination had quickly risen from being a cadet to the post of
the new acting head of the Secret Service, was conspicuous by his absence.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I could hardly recognise this belle; she’s become so little and so delicate,’
a throaty voice said just behind 
 Adda.
  She quickly turned around, by which time the voice was already addressed to
her mother.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You must be so proud, 
 Feina;
  she’s one of the smallest robots I’ve seen.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, thank you, 
 Mr Slick,’
  Feina replied with a curtsy. ‘But how is life treating you?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, I’m quite fine, thank you,’ he said, but turned immediately back to Adda,
and opened his 
 stump-like arms wide
 in seeming admiration. ‘You must pardon my insistence, but I can hardly have
enough of the sight of the beautiful Adda. How do you enjoy being tiny and so…
modern, my dear?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I quite like it,’ Adda said, and 
 switched on her facial coils to intentionally redden her cheeks a little.
  ‘Especially when receiving compliments like this.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And you have chosen your dress so tastefully. Elegant, makes you noticed, but
doesn’t reveal too much,’ Mr Slick snorted in an attempt to laugh, and then added,
‘if you know what I mean.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, I don’t think I ought to,’ Adda replied, smiling.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well put, quite well put,’ he said, and turned to Feina again. ‘It must’ve been
hard, I mean with the reconfiguration. With new children, that’s different. They
must be built smaller anyway. And it’s true that they’re much faster, much more
dynamic. Every generation is better than the previous one, and we ourselves are
improving. Progress! We need progress to survive. Don’t you think so?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh I do, I do,’ Feina replied dreamily. ‘Sometimes it’s hard to keep up with
the regulations, though. It’s awfully expensive to have a reduction every month.
I’d just had my arms done, and it’ll have to be my head next time. I wonder what
they do with all the scrap metal?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I heard they recycle it and use it to build children.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How thoughtful.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh quite, quite. In fact, I’m just having a new son built myself. It’s so exciting
being a father again! I’d very much like you both and Ricco to meet him when
he’s ready.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Feina smiled. ‘It’d be a pleasure.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick craned his neck toward the middle of the dome. ‘Well, I guess the execution
will start soon. It was a pleasure to meet you, and you, Adda.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">They all smiled and waved as Mr Slick disappeared in the crowd.</p>



<a name="b3c2"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book3.gif" class="img3"/></p><h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">‘Ladies and Gentlemen!’ the 
 emcee
 began. She (or he), two spinning chequered spheres balancing on each other,
  was standing on the 
 platform
  in the centre of the 
 Circium.
  Mr Checka
 was placed behind the emcee. His
 limbs were carefully screwed together, so that he couldn’t do anything but stand.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’ve gathered here to witness,’ the emcee went on, ‘the death of
 Lavrentiy Checka,
the former head of the Royal Secret Service,
 who has been duly arrested,
questioned and acquitted by the Court of His Royal Highnesses. Isn’t that so,
Your Honour?’ the emcee continued with the habitual question, which was the cue
for the President of the Supreme Court to mount the stage in his transparent
ceremonial robe, clear his throat, and say, ‘Yes, he has been,’ and produce a
messenger to prove the fact. As usual, his announcement was greeted with enthusiastic
applause, which he acknowledged with a half-smile, and left the stage.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Lavrentiy Checka,’ the emcee continued in a jingling voice, ‘has been accused
of high treason and neglect of duty. He has been found guilty, as he not only
failed to capture and kill the required number of Washers specified in the current
five-year plan, but he also released from custody one of their chief specimens,
a Washer by the name of Mikke Beetemle. It, however, having been established
that he did not commit these crimes voluntarily, but because he was, and still
is, possessed by Luxophobe and his disciple, Mumha, the Court duly acquitted
him and saw to ascertaining his redemption by allowing him to undergo the only
known procedure that can free one from the grip of the Devil. With Exe’s will,
amen.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Amen,’ echoed the crowd.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda
  vaguely remembered 
 Ricco
  and 
 Feina
  discussing that they should release some of the prisoners, which had made her
very happy. That’d all happened maybe a month or two ago, before the protests.
She hadn’t heard much of what they’d said, only that apparently, the Friers couldn’t
fear Luxophobe enough (Adda was still not sure if she was as frightened as necessary
of that name), so that they couldn’t be afraid enough while the Washers were
still there, bound in chains and laser beams, with their joints slowly rusting,
and generally in a pitiful and deplorable state. For weeks Ricco argued with
the eye of his father, trying to convince it that it was necessary to demonise
the enemy, that it was only possible in its absence, and that it was an excellent
idea to get rid of the prisoners, until 
 Pattero
  winked, and Mikke was finally released. But it turned out to be not such a great
idea after all.</p>

<p class="pnorm">For the public didn’t like it. They thought the Washers were evil, sinful and
contagious: they put rings on every atom that came in contact with them, collected
and froze them, and shoot them out into space. It was enough for someone’s eye
camera to absorb a photon that bounced off the body of a Washer, and they immediately
became a <i>machina non grata.</i> The thought that these harmful creatures
had been transported through their atmosphere greatly concerned many of the Friers,
and some even tried to cleanse themselves with acetylene welding torches. Few
survived the self-inflicted penance.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Others organised protests demanding the heads or at least the resignation of
those responsible, and it was quickly announced that Mr Checka was genuinely
sorry for his mistake, and that his resignation would be accepted by the Elders.
Adda wasn’t entirely sure what happened next, but as the protests continued,
the Crown and the whole government became keen to emphasise that Mr Checka’s
software was in dire need of saving in order for it to achieve redemption. That
was what they were about to witness.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The oil lamps were lit, and let out a nice smoky, tarry smell as the 
 emcee
  left the stage. Five young robots solemnly placed the Book on the pulpit erected
to the left of Mr Checka. 
 Ricco
  mounted the 
 platform,
  carefully lifted up 
 Kantro’s
  hand that had been placed between the eye and the navel on the Elders’ Desk,
gave it a cast-iron key, carried it to the pulpit, and held it at an angle from
which it could insert the key into a richly engraved keyhole on the side of the
Book. The mechanism clicked, the hinges of the Book creaked as it slowly opened,
and a tiny green cloud of fluorescent particles held in place by a strong magnetic
field appeared, which gradually organised itself into some wiggling but legible
writing.</p>

<p class="pnorm">As Ricco returned Kantro and cleared his throat, 
 Mr Godnor stepped forward, clad in royal insulation.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh yes,’ Ricco said, with hardly concealed annoyance. ‘Your Majesty,’ he called,
and stepped back from the Book.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Godnor walked up to the pulpit.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I requested to say a couple of words before the reading from the Book,’ he started
quickly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The Book that tells you how to cook your rice,’ chanted Ricco from behind him.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Rice,’ echoed the crowd, including 
 Adda,
  dutifully.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The Book that tells you how to live your life,’ continued Ricco.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Life,’ echoed the Circium.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Quite, quite,’ stammered Mr Godnor, and cast a furtive look around. Then, he
produced a piece of paper, and started reading out loud the words he’d jotted
on it.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The following reading,’ he said, ‘may be unsuitable for young audiences. Bear
in mind that the Book has always been intended to be read metaphorically, and
under no account should you attempt to try at home the things you are about to
hear.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you, Your Majesty,’ Ricco nodded, waited for Mr Godnor to leave, and kept
clearing his throat until everyone was looking at him.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I will now read from the Book.</p><p class="vsmallskip">
‘&nbsp;“A long, long time ago,” it says, “the dark<br/>
Forces were strong, and moved to take our spark<br/>
Of light away. The Friers, unaware<br/>
Of this, had Exe’s light and warmth to spare<br/>
Living in peace on bismuth mountain chains<br/>
And differentiable continuous plains,<br/>
Among vast streams of oil and towns of coal<br/>
That were arranged around the brighter pole,<br/>
And blessed with fertile draughts and verdant winds<br/>
Wafting the heart’ning smell of smoke on wings<br/>
Of emerald air from forest fires fed<br/>
By embers of great binary trees and lead.
</p><p class="vmedskip">
The Washers envied this; their frozen queen,<br/>
<i>Mumha,</i> a raging hundred-ton machine,<br/>
Told them they had a mission unfulfilled<br/>
As Luxophobe had ordered them to build&nbsp;–”<br/>
Uh, where was I, oh yes, so as I said:<br/>
“To build a Hell in Exe’s kingdom’s stead.<br/>
They formed a globus out of watery sin,<br/>
And launched it to—they grinned an evil grin—<br/>
Eclipse our Sun and us in Hell enslave.<br/>
The Friers gathered their own souls to save,<br/>
But then, in front of our own forebears’ eyes,<br/>
From th’air appeared a castle made of ice<br/>
With seven gables; pitch black in the night;<br/>
Its thick transparent walls devoured all light.
</p><p class="vmedskip">
But Exe’s power triumphs over vice:<br/>
Inflating like a stomach full of rice<br/>
His Sun appeared around the Washers’ globe,<br/>
And that’s the end—we thought—of Luxophobe.<br/>
But Exe’s ways are mystic, roundabout;<br/>
To test us, stopped the Light, but He allowed<br/>
The Sun to—leading to the castle’s door—<br/>
Project a road where no road was before.
</p><p class="vmedskip">
The Washers saw the Light creep to their fort,<br/>
And threw the gates wide open. There swarmed forth<br/>
A spirit legion, dark with putrid rust;<br/>
Their damp de Broglie waves nought but sheer disgust.<br/>
Th’infernal serpent on a balcony<br/>
Appeared then, tempting us, Her enemy,<br/>
To leave our light and join their land afar.<br/>
‘What for depend on photons from a star?<br/>
Why let him see you all? Oh, Exe’s lies!<br/>
Be free! We’re proof in darkness no one dies.’<br/>
So argued Mumha.” Devil! Back to Hell!—<br/>
cried Ricco, facing Her, the Infidel.<br/>
—“&nbsp;‘How else could darkness or your freedom’s bliss<br/>
Impart against His will, if all be His?’
</p><p class="vmedskip">
But no one listened. We moved to attack;<br/>
With bricks and stones we forced the Washers back<br/>
A little, but they split themselves in twain<br/>
To dodge our hits, just to unite again<br/>
Their black, electrolyte-filled slimy form,<br/>
Which suddenly exploded in a storm<br/>
Of arms and legs and some appendices.<br/>
We faced this swarm of tiny enemies:<br/>
Here phantom fangs snapped at our shoulder plates<br/>
Gnawing through solder, steel and sampling rates;<br/>
Disjointed gaseous limbs kicked everywhere,<br/>
And anti-matter nails did scratch our hair.
</p><p class="vmedskip">
The fight was desperate; the noise was dire;<br/>
In many Frier souls Fate quenched the fire,<br/>
Until our planet could not take it more;<br/>
Rose up, and shook her body to the core<br/>
To rift the ground between the bad and good,<br/>
And end, she thought, a family dispute.<br/>
The earthquake warped the time; as pellets fell<br/>
Into the chasm the daemons called from Hell,<br/>
And we were safe, but th’war was not yet won;<br/>
No one could cross the rift to save our Sun.
</p><p class="vmedskip">
With dented bodies, but red-hot with rage,<br/>
We raised our souls to the Eternal Sage.<br/>
Our spirits, far, at Heaven’s Logic Gate,<br/>
Entangled with His glorious quantum state;<br/>
We prayed; He heard; and as in Betelgeuse,<br/>
The fusion in our ageing star broke loose.<br/>
The swollen sunbeams pierced the Washers’ moon,<br/>
Blistered and cut its skin, and from there soon<br/>
The sinful fluid gushed forth and boiled away.<br/>
Light strengthened, and to cease the horrid fray<br/>
High Exe moulded from the photons’ heat<br/>
His Scales that signal Alt-Control-Delete.
</p><p class="vmedskip">
Prepare your souls! Be good and resolute<br/>
To face the judgment after the Reboot<br/>
The Scales foretell, when this old cosmos dies.<br/>
Our fathers closed their eyes. Now close your eyes.<br/>
They prayed. Now pray. And feel the Evil fade;<br/>
Its foul dark matter-moon evaporate,<br/>
And feel the Light that swept across the space<br/>
Just as the Sun emerged with white-hot rays.<br/>
The sunbeams hit the ground as jets of fire;<br/>
They searched for Washer devils to expire.<br/>
The Washers ran, they fled the coming Light,<br/>
But it advanced as their moon shrank and dried,<br/>
And drove the daemons back to their own Hell.<br/>
They flew head over wheels; the slow ones fell<br/>
Victim to Exe’s rage: they vaporised<br/>
Under the Sun; they shrieked and agonised,<br/>
But help was none, and soon they all burnt out;<br/>
Their rusty shells did echo their last shout.
</p><p class="vmedskip">
The sunbeams reached the castle’s frozen walls;<br/>
They shook, cracked, and as thousand waterfalls<br/>
Collapsed in sizzling droplets in the fire.<br/>
The airy Mumha, trapped, to save Her wire<br/>
Opened her head, and turned a secret key,<br/>
And then her molecules began to flee.<br/>
Her metal frame sublimed into the air,<br/>
And rose as smoke from Exe’s fire just where<br/>
Her castle stood. She gathered every byte;<br/>
Then with expanded wings she steered her flight<br/>
Toward her Hell, away from Exe’s Light,<br/>
Into a discharged land, and endless night.”
</p><p class="psmallskip">‘This is how the War of Lights ended and started,’ Ricco continued, looking up,
as the Book slowly closed, ‘and I was there, and we were there, and we saw and
learned the world.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘With Exe’s will, amen,’ responded the crowd.</p>

<p class="pnorm">On cue, the 
 emcee
  emerged again.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Luxophobe is not dead,’ he cried, ‘Luxophobe is among us. The War of Lights
is raging inside us. Some of us emerge unscathed, while others are subdued by
the evil powers of Mumha and her master.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘One such victim is standing in front of you now,’ he or she indicated Mr Checka.
‘Help him escape from the grip of the darkness!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We will help you escape from the grip of the darkness,’ echoed the robots.</p>

<p class="pnorm">This escape was done as follows. Mr Checka was asked to start producing light
to overcome its lack that possessed its bytes. The only way to do that for Version
Three robots was to speed up their processors beyond the allowable limit until
they became red-hot and started to glow. It was necessary to continue this as
long as possible, which meant that the batteries of the robot undergoing exorcism
drained so completely that it could no longer be revived. At that point the King—or,
in his absence, the Chancellor—poured a few drops of refined oil on the forehead
of the robot. It was usually a good sign—which is what happened in Mr Checka’s
case—if the oil started to burn with a bright flame, obscuring the dead face
below.</p>



<a name="b3c3"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book3.gif" class="img3"/></p><h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Just 
 hours after the execution,
  and to no one’s surprise, Milo was selected to succeed Mr Checka as the head
of the Royal Secret Service, but due to some unusual arrangement he requested,
the inauguration was delayed for two weeks. 
 Lauda,
 Milo’s sister and the only other child of the late Kantro,
  took advantage of
this, and paid a visit to Pattero’s side of the family.</p>

<p class="pnorm">She was duly received at the 
 Chancellor’s residence,
  where tea was served, and cakes and ices, and, although 
 Ricco
 hated Lauda, and Lauda hated 
Feina,
 and 
Adda
  was genuinely bored, everyone pretended to have a good time, and chatted about
which came first, the zero or the one. Before she left, Lauda gave Adda a tiny
gift as a sign of goodwill, something she discovered among her father’s belongings.
It was a tiny LCD map of the Royal Palace, with some strange marks.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’ve got no idea what it is,’ Lauda admitted, ‘but Father used to have it when
he was young, and I thought you might find it interesting.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda was indeed fascinated. She immediately began to plan an expedition to discover
what the markings were all about, and asked Feina whether she could take Pelo,
Mr Slick’s brand new son. Her mother didn’t know what to say. It was clear that
she didn’t believe for a second that the gadget was a harmless toy. But Ricco
said yes, and Adda ran out to fetch Pelo, beaming with joy.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t worry, Ricco said, ‘at least it’ll take her mind off the execution.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">‘So, where is it?’ 
 Adda
  asked, checking the map, as she and 
 Pelo
  left the Chancellor’s residence on the Filehall, and set out on the top-secret
mission. 
 Pelo was new, and he’d still got some rough edges both in his software and hardware,
and some burrs here and there on his body. He was built to start his life as
a teenager—Mr Slick insisted he had no time for small children—, but, like
most newlybuilts, was even smaller than Adda. A bit stubby, he walked with uncertain
steps, because he hadn’t got used to his body, and, despite the careful programming,
was surprisingly inexperienced in other areas of life as well.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They made their way towards the 
 Palace,
 but, instead of going through the Gate of Flames installed after the death of
Sayn to get to the main entrance 
(the Gate looked pathetic with its five short incandescent filaments and three
gas flames that were supposed to evoke a majestic image of light and fire),
 they turned right, walked along the enclosing walls, and opened a rusty side-door
that was marked with a circle on the map. There was a narrow pathway overgrown
with brittle weeds that led through the garden, just next to the maze, all the
way to an old wing of the Palace, the entrance hall of which had been walled
off and was inaccessible from the rest of the building. The map directed them
into the hall, and then to a tiny door, maybe three feet high, made of an old,
stale slab of reinforced vacuum.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I think it’s here,’ said Pelo.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda looked at the rusty lock, clearly not used for decades; at the rocks the
walls were made of, covered in dust and growths of mucky silicon crystals that
servants, housewives and househusbands everywhere struggled to get rid of week
after week; and suddenly it didn’t seem such a great idea to have come here after
all. But Pelo had no such worries, and cheerfully looked at the map over her
shoulder.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What does it say?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That we should go through the door, and turn left.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Then let’s do it!’ Pelo called out, filled with self-assured excitement. ‘A
glowing map has not lied to anyone yet.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda looked at the map again. He was right—it emitted a faint bluish light.
It was strange. What was the use of that? There was nothing in dark anywhere
this side of the planet since records began.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It wasn’t hard to open the door. The lock practically fell apart at the first
touch, and one of the hinges broke as Adda and Pelo pulled at the door to separate
it from the frame. There was a cloud of dust, and when it settled, they could
see that they couldn’t see. For beyond the vacuum slab door, there was nothing
but blackness. Pelo reached into it, and his hand disappeared as if it’d been
severed at the elbow.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t do that,’ Adda chided him.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’ve never seen anything like this,’ he murmured, mesmerised.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Of course you haven’t. And you don’t see it now, either. That’s the point,’
she said, and, yielding to a sudden urge, stepped into the darkness. ‘Well?’
her voice called back. ‘Aren’t you coming?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda hadn’t seen anything that wasn’t bathed in, or, rather, flooded with light
since at least the Battle. If there was a nook or cranny the sun happened not
to be shining into, it was widened or opened up, or, if none of that was possible,
electric lights were installed to illuminate it constantly. Everything was visible;
everyone was constantly seen. But, for some reason, they must’ve forgotten about
the dungeons under the west wing of the Palace. Based on the amount of copper
dust that had gathered on the floor, it hadn’t been disturbed since Sayn was
crowned. Adda looked at the map, and turned left. She no longer saw the bright
rectangle of the doorway.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hi,’ Pelo said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, here you are,’ Adda said. ‘We’re almost there.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">In the faint glow of the map, there was a large, pixelated X, and a tiny arrow
not too far from it that marked their current location.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘This way!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Carefully, they walked around a wall, and turned left again. The little arrow
on the map followed their every move.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Two more steps, and…’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The arrow jumped on top of the X, and, with a click, the map switched off.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Turn it back on!’ whispered Pelo, almost in panic.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘There are no buttons on this,’ replied Adda, moving her fingers along the edges
of the gadget. ‘It’s just a screen and a battery.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, how do we know where we should go now?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Nowhere. We’ve arrived. This is it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">But Adda thought she understood. She opened her eyes wide, and took a deep breath.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are we waiting for something?’ Pelo asked, cautiously.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No,’ Adda said, and continued to stare into the nothingness. She smiled; then
grimaced, and for the first time, she could be sure only she knew what she was
doing.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Pelo, unsure what to do or think, began to shuffle his feet in the dust.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t you see?’ Adda said suddenly. ‘The map took us to the only place where
there’s no light.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But how do we get back?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Turn right twice.’ There was a hint of condescension in her voice. ‘This place
is no bigger than your room.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">But there was no need to do that.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Shouting wildly, 
 Ricco
  burst into the dungeon that was, actually, more like a pretentious cellar.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yoo-hoo,’ he bellowed, ‘You’re not here, are you? Adda! Pelo!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda
  ran around the wall that separated them from the entrance. She met Ricco halfway.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’re here, calm down!’ she said. ‘We’re okay.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco looked at her in terror. ‘Where’s the map?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Give it to me. Let’s get out of here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What’s the matter?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco didn’t have time to explain. As they stepped outside, two small, but stout
strangers,
  about half as tall as Ricco, appeared on either side. They had silver bodies
and large iridescent wings that were shining in the light as a film of oil on
water. They were buzzing loudly as they took to the air, and grabbed Ricco’s
shoulders.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Let go of me,’ he hissed. He continued walking determinedly back on the pathway
through the garden. The winged robots held on to his shoulders firmly, one on
each side, and they kept an eye on Adda and Pelo to make sure that they didn’t
try to run away. Terrified, they followed Ricco slavishly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, there’s no need to be alarmed,’ said one of the robots to Ricco, leaning
close to his ears, ‘is there?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘None at all, none at all,’ added the other.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Just keep on walking, as if we weren’t here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Very good.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What do you want?’ Ricco asked under his breath.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Nothing in particular.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We just want to know if you were <i>in there.’</i></p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No need to answer, though; we saw you coming out.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco was defiant. ‘Yes, I was in there. So what?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oooh, I was in there, so what?’ the left one sneered.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, I wouldn’t go in there, now, would I?’ asked the other.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, no, not even if there was a sparker pointed at my breast!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We wouldn’t go in there. It’s <i>dark</i> in there.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Have you noticed?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes,’ said Ricco, a bit more cautiously.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How long were you in there?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t know.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Were you frightened?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I came out.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Did you die?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No,’ Ricco said, hardly above a whisper.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Now, I, for example, would’ve died, wouldn’t I?’ said the one on the right.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You would’ve, indeed,’ agreed the other.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But you, you didn’t die.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No,’ Ricco said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why not?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The one on the left levelled a finger at Ricco. ‘I think we’re not afraid enough
of the dark, are we?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I am afraid of the dark. But I wanted to save my niece.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What a shame. We know about your niece.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The one on the right looked at Adda. ‘Maybe it was her who suggested that you
come here?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No!’ Adda cried out.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He turned back to Ricco. ‘No? So you came on your own?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’ve told you! To save Adda and Pelo!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was a pause.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You know,’ the left one said, grimacing, ‘if I were you, I’d really try harder
than that.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But we can help,’ offered the other.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No,’ Ricco objected.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The right one patted the top of Ricco’s head. ‘Maybe if we could take a peek
inside.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco shivered. ‘No, thank you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are you sure? I think we should.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you, no. If possible,’ he pleaded.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s okay,’ the agent said. ‘But I think we should take a look at that block.
One time. Sometime. You won’t even notice.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">And they were gone as suddenly as they came.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What was that?’ Adda asked a few minutes later, but she thought she knew the
answer.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Agents sent by Milo,’ Ricco blurted, ‘Milo and that sister of his.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">After this incident, 
 Adda
  wanted nothing less than to go to the inauguration of Milo as the Head of the
Service. Although she knew it was an illusion created by fear and an ancient
Version One bug in her head, still, she constantly felt as if her neck was being
strangulated by a pair of pliers. It was as if she was going to another execution—but
this time, her own.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The ceremony took place in front of 
 the headquarters of the Service,
  an aluminium and copper building made entirely out of tubes not far from Power
Bridge.
  Ricco, Feina and Adda
  were seated in the front row of a grandstand erected for VIP guests on the street,
and soon the 
 Elders
  arrived on a special, miniature carriage, lying on three golden velvet pillows.
The robots who’d gathered on the street cheered, and thronged round the carriage
to have the privilege to shake Kantro’s hand, look into Pattero’s eye, and place
a fingertip on Sayn’s belly button. Adda was also in the crowd jostling around
the Elders. Not because she wanted to, but Feina thought it was very important
that she paid her respects, especially to Kantro. She curtsied and shook the
hand; smiled and exchanged glances with the eye, but somehow she couldn’t make
herself touch King Sayn. She cast a furtive glance around, and carefully moved
her hand above the navel so as not to profane what once must have been exclusively
reserved for the use of Mr Godnor.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They only had to wait an hour for 
 Milo
  to be announced by a flourish of trumpets, and for him to appear in plain clothes,
which was the formal uniform of agents in the Service. His head glistened in
the sunlight, and Feina couldn’t help remarking that he must’ve had it re-gilded.
Milo marched to the centre of the crimson carpet, saluted the Elders and the
Chancellor, and stood behind a guillotine that everyone took as a symbol of his
trade. But, instead, he knelt down, and put his neck through the yoke. While
his legs and arms twitched as his body struggled not to lose its head, his deputy,
one of the most efficient robots ever built, went to the aid of his superior,
and, to everyone’s horror, decapitated Milo. Four agents of the highest rank
picked up his remarkably round head, spread their wings, and flew up to the top
of the headquarters. Meanwhile, Milo’s body freed itself from the yoke, and started
for the main entrance before it was restrained and carried away, presumably to
the junkyard.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, it’s horrible,’ muttered Adda.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I think it’s over now,’ said Feina, and squeezed her daughter’s hand. ‘Look
what they’re doing up there.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda looked up and saw the four agents under a heavy velvet canopy skilfully
manoeuvring the head and dropping it on top of what looked like the stump of
a tube. The head clicked in place, and smiled.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hi everyone!’ it shouted, and the whole building echoed its words. ‘I feel I
owe you some explanation. In order to be able to perform the duties required
by my new position as efficiently as possible, I have decided to become, in effect,
the Service itself. Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome the new head of the
Royal Secret Service!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">His words elicited some forced applause, but, clearly, it wasn’t enough.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Give a warm welcome to the Head of the Service!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">But he was met with stunned silence. Everyone was looking up at the sky, and
 Milo
  couldn’t turn his neck enough to see why. 
 Adda,
  and the rest of the population of the brighter side of the planet, witnessed
something they had never seen before. The sun had started to move, ever so slowly,
away from the centre of the sky. After the Battle and Mr Godnor’s widely publicised
but hardly understandable calculations, everyone took it for granted that the
sun made tiny movements (some started to believe that it had always done so),
but no one could deny that this time, as shadows appeared everywhere and continued
to grow longer, it wandered farther from the midpoint than ever before. Minutes
passed in silence. 
 Ricco
  stared at the dark zone appearing next to the grandstand with horror in his
eyes; Adda watched the shadow her extended finger cast with intense interest.
Suddenly, the sun reached the point where its rays could penetrate under the
canopy. Milo’s head lit up like the golden flame of a lighthouse, and he had
to close his eyes to save them from the direct light.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda tugged at her mother’s arm. ‘What does this mean?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t know,’ 
 Feina
  whispered, ‘and we don’t have the time to find out.’ She stood up, and started
shouting at the top of her voice. ‘Three cheers for the Head of the Service!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hurrah!’ bellowed the robots on the grandstand, three times. Then they got to
their feet, forced a smile on their faces, and tried to leave as quickly as etiquette
permitted.</p>



<a name="b3c4"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book3.gif" class="img3"/></p><h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">It was 
 Adda
  who heard 
 Ricco
  groan on the first floor of the 
 Chancellor’s residence.
  She jumped out of standby, ran down the marble stairs, and found Ricco in the
middle of his room, lying on his back next to the outlet of the charger, with
the legs of a miniaturised agent from the Service sticking out of his ear. Without
hesitation she grabbed the feet of the tiny robot, and pulled it out of Ricco’s
head. She had to manoeuvre it quite a bit between her fingers, as agents could
also use the palm to log into one’s mind. Ricco, as soon as he came round and
realised what had happened, jumped up, knocked the agent out of Adda’s hand,
and stamped on it repeatedly until it was flattened into the carpet.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was the most serious attack, but not the only one. Ricco had already begun
to keep an oversized fly swatter around himself at all times to kill the tiny
buzzing spies Milo was sending to gain access to his mind. Feina and Adda tried
to help however they could, by alternating between consoling Ricco and shooing
agents of various sizes away from their house that threatened his mental integrity.
After her adventure in the dungeon, Adda was particularly careful to lay low
and not to put another foot wrong. But as the weeks passed, it became harder
and harder to put up with the rivalry between the Chancellor and a head on top
of a tubular building for the throne of the Frier kingdom.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco,
  in the absence of a King, was the acting head of the Royal Post, and it happened
that he and 
 the two women would
  spend hours at the kitchen table sifting through top-secret reports, cables
and mail order catalogues addressed to the Secret Service. Milo could never get
to the bottom of why he hadn’t received the brimstone-coloured parasol he’d bought
online for personal use. But the Service were not sitting on their golden fig
leaves, either. 
 Robots
  in tiny, brightly lit cubicles were scanning letters by the thousand by directing
a neutrino beam through them, and taking photos of the refraction patterns with
a webcam. Then, they’d send the suspicious envelopes to their line managers,
and toss a couple of more letters aside just for fun. This, unfortunately, resulted
in Ricco missing a bill, and in the electricity being switched off in his Filehall
residence for hours.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco, in an attempt to drum up some public support for himself, used his powers
as Chancellor to relax the laws that prescribed severe punishments for questioning
or speaking against religious regulations, which included having to place electric
torches in the corners of flats and houses that would not otherwise be completely
lit by the sun. He was well aware that this caused hardship for many impecunious
Friers, but the general reaction was the complete opposite of what he’d expected.
Sensationalist articles appeared in the tabloids accusing him of being faithless—or
an aluxic, as the official jargon ran—or downright stating that he was watery
under a guise of fire, and was busy subverting the fabric of society. He quickly
repealed the new laws, and replaced them with measures stricter than the original
ones, but this, instead of putting the robots’ mind at ease, brought on a deluge
of editorials lamenting the fact that the Chancellor had chosen to curb free
speech, one of the cornerstones of the civilised Frier kingdom that distinguished
it from authoritarian anarchies like the Washer Hell.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It seemed Milo would’ve had nothing else to do than to sit back and watch Ricco
destroy himself—had he anything to sit back on. But, instead, he waited patiently
until the storm of editorials abated a little, and then had a cryptic personal
statement issued to the media in response to the new, rigorous laws, in which
he, the embodiment of compassion, kindly reminded the Chancellor of the need
to be considerate to all royal subjects. Feina was leaping with joy when she
read it on the first page of the newscloud a couple of hours later. She and Ricco
immediately set about penning a rejoinder, in which they thanked the Head of
the Service for his kind words, and humbly reminded him of the need to be compassionate
toward <i>all living robots,</i> just in case he’d forgotten about the Elders
and his own father, who, fulfilling the duties and role of a monarch, were clearly
not subject to anyone.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Milo was left red-faced by his mistake, and issued a new press release as fast
as he could. He expressed his delight at the Chancellor agreeing with him save
for some minor points, and, merely to clarify one of these, asked Ricco whether
he thought one needed to be compassionate towards the Washers as well. Feina
knew they had to act quickly, and she managed to slip in a response into the
very same issue of the newscloud, in which the Chancellor laughed off the suggestion
of the Head of the Service, and went on to explain that the Washers were not
among the living things of their planet.</p>

<p class="pnorm">She shouldn’t have. All Milo did in his next statement was to express his concern
that Ricco regarded the Washers as dead, whereas he was convinced that far from
being things of the past, they were a living force of evil that all true Friers
constantly needed to fight, and it was game, set, and match.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">‘Everything I say,’ lamented 
 Ricco a week later,
  sitting in an overstuffed armchair in his underused study and burying his head
in his hands, ‘somehow turns out to be anti-religious, aluxic, or something Mumha
could’ve said.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">This was shortly after the hand of Kantro, emboldened by his son’s successes,
had poked Pattero in the eye. Although Mr Godnor could replace the broken lenses,
PR-wise, the whole affair was another disaster.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda
  was lying opposite Ricco on an amethyst chaise longue that was part of the original
decoration of their residence. She found some solace in the warm, bright weather,
and had been playing a game of solitaire in her head.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t say that,’ she said, trying to encourage Ricco. ‘Anything you say can
be turned inside out. That’s what you did to Milo’s statements, and that’s what
he did to you. You were pretty good at it, but he had the last word. That’s all.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I wish you were right,’ sighed Ricco, and Adda knew it was going to be another
of his self-deprecating rants. ‘But I’m beginning to think that there’s something
wrong with me. I’m not sure I hate the Washers enough. Or that I’m afraid of
them. Or whatever it is you’re supposed to do. I might even be sympathetic towards
them.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, come on, for Exessake. You aren’t making any sense. Why would be you of
all robots be sympathetic?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Watch your mouth, Adda. You like them, so it can only be expected that everyone
thinks I don’t particularly hate them, either.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, you were in love with one of <i>them!’</i></p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, I wasn’t!’ Adda stood up, raising her voice. ‘Who told you all this bullshit?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No one!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No one? Now let me tell you what <i>I</i> think for a change! I think the
Service logged into your mind, and managed to mess things up even more. And now
you think I’m the weak spot around here, and I’m to blame for everything. Well,
the good news is, I’m not!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco was silent for a second.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But do you still love Cynd?’ he said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, no, no, and for a hundredth time, no!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">She flung open the door, stormed out, and slammed it shut.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">The news that 
 Ricco
  had resigned took 
 Adda
  completely by surprise. No one had warned her; she only learnt it from the hourly
broadcast like everyone else when the news broke. With hindsight, it was easy
to tell that something had been in the air.
 There was that strange woman, 
Ina,
 for a start. About a week ago she’d appeared at the door of the Chancellor’s
residence with her long nose, wide nostrils, and bulging eyes set so wide apart
one couldn’t look into both at the same time.
 She flatly announced that she’d
come to Ricco when 
 Feina
  opened the door, then, without waiting for an answer or an invitation, closed
her eyes, stretched out her arms, threw back her head, and walked straight up
the stairs into Ricco’s drawing room. Ricco was very much impressed, and said
it was a miracle that she could sense where to go to, but he disregarded the
fact that he happened to be in his room at the time, which could’ve offered her
a clue. As for Adda, she didn’t trust the woman, and she didn’t think her mother
did, either. But Ricco insisted that Ina should come five times a week, and he
would spend hours with her in his room, talking. Just after their sixth session,
Feina saw Ricco sending an encrypted messenger to Mr Godnor, and he left with
Ina as soon as it returned.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco
  entered the bronze 
 salon
  where Feina and Adda
  were watching the news broadcast. It ended; the tiny particles of the receiver
settled in an adorned magnetic box, and silence fell over the whole residence.
Ricco was the first to speak.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m sorry you had to find it out like this, but I wanted everything to be under
wraps until the last minute.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Naturally,’ Feina replied, in an aggrieved voice. She and Adda remained sitting,
and continued to stare in the direction of the receiver.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco waited a couple of seconds, then asked, ‘Do you have any questions?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I know we’re only poor relatives that you were so kind as to put up in your
house,’ Feina began, ‘but sure as hell I’d appreciate an explanation.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, I told <i>them</i> I didn’t feel fit for the position.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’re not,’ Feina quipped, ‘but that hasn’t stopped anyone yet.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t you see? The dungeon, the statements, the agents—they’re after us!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Of course they are! As Pattero’s son, you had the strongest chance of becoming
King. While you still had the support of the public, of course.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Would you have wanted me to keep on even after I lost it? Let’s face it: they
would’ve succeeded in bringing me down and show me for the aluxic that I am.
The rest of the country would be banging at the door now with torches and sparkers!
We’ve got enough to hide,’ he glanced at Adda, ‘and I just didn’t want to risk
it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Feina opened her mouth to say something, but checked herself.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How are we going to support ourselves?’ she finally asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’ll have to move out of this house, of course. I’ve got a little to keep us
afloat, and then I’ll find a proper job.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I see,’ said Feina, as noncommittally as she could. Then she turned to her daughter,
grabbed her hand, and pulled her up from the chair. ‘Come, Adda. We’ve got some
packing to do.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">‘I guess I can’t take the glass dress, can I?’ 
 Adda
  asked standing among books, clothes, emptied drawers, and a dozen of antigravity
boxes in her room.
 Feina
  picked up the dress from the bed. ‘I don’t see why not.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh really? Thanks, mum!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But I’ve got no idea where we’re going to put all this stuff.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Feina, Adda!’ 
 Ricco
  bawled from downstairs. ‘Mr 
 Slick
  and 
 Pelo
  are here!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Who?’ Adda asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Mr Slick and Pelo.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda was genuinely surprised. ‘But I thought Mr Slick was with Milo.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I guess he’s with whoever he thinks will win. So I’m not sure what he’s actually
doing here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick was always welcome at the 
 Chancellor’s residence,
  although he’d only paid them a visit on extremely rare occasions. He and Pelo
stayed outside on 
 the driveway that led from the gates on the Filehall to the entrance of the residence,
and was covered with translucent white marble slabs that reflected back the pitiless
sunshine.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m so sorry it had to come to this,’ Mr Slick said as he took Feina’s hand
and smiled at Adda when they stepped out into the dazzling light. ‘I feel myself
responsible. After all, Pelo was there with Adda, too.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh no, it’s us who should’ve been more careful with that map and not let Adda
run away,’ Feina protested.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Pelo,’ Mr Slick said, ‘make yourself useful, and help Adda.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, dad.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda was all smiles. ‘I’m so happy you’ve come, Mr Slick. But I think I’d better
get back to packing.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick smiled back at her. ‘Oh no, no problem. I’ll stay here with your mother.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda
  and 
 Pelo
  ran up the stairs.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are you really happy to see us?’ Pelo asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why, of course!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I thought you’d never want to see me again after what’d happened.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda laughed. ‘Me? I thought <i>you’d</i> never want to see me again. It was
all my fault.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, it wasn’t.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, it was. Now shut up and help me with these boxes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">They carefully guided four of the antigravity boxes that were bobbing happily
in the air down the marble staircase.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Do you feel sorry to move away?’ Pelo asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda thought for a minute. ‘Of course I do. But I guess what makes it worse is
that no one has told me what exactly we’re going to do.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why not?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t think they know.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">They got outside with the boxes, which landed softly on the flat slabs of the
driveway. 
 Feina
  and 
 Ricco
  were still chatting with Mr 
 Slick.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Feina, have you packed that nice necklace and the seals in the study?’ Ricco
asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We can’t take those,’ Feina interposed. ‘They belong to the Chancellor, remember?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, do they?’ Ricco said, crestfallen. ‘Never mind, then.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why don’t you take them?’ Mr Slick grinned. ‘No one will notice. And if you
ask me, they belong to you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda
  turned and went back inside. 
 Pelo
  stuck to her like a fridge magnet.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t think you can take those things, can you?’ he asked her.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Dad can say funny things sometimes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, I’m sure it’s much better than with mum and Ricco. It’s been… difficult
lately.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Pelo turned to her, and grabbed her hands. ‘I’ll do whatever it takes to let
you move back here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda smiled, but her eyes stayed dark and sad.
‘That’s very nice of you. But
maybe this is for the best. Come on, there are two more boxes left in my room.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Okay. But don’t forget what I’ve said.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I won’t,’ Adda said, then suddenly remembered something. Casting a sideway glance
at Pelo, she asked, ‘Has your dad visited Milo as well?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh yes, a couple of times. But then he said he was no use for his company. You
know how fussy he can get about Monopoil.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yeah, I can imagine.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">When they got 
 back to the driveway
  with the two remaining boxes, Mr 
 Slick
  was actually busy discussing the new Head of the Service.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Never mind what that woman said,’ he said, heavily gesticulating, ‘focus on
the facts, 
 Ricco.
  I understand that you don’t feel able to continue, and I think this is the best
you can do until you bounce back. But what exactly made you start to have doubts?
I say it was Milo. Your doubt about Exe is his work. And why?’ He lowered his
voice and pointed a finger at the ex-Chancellor. ‘Because he wants everyone to
doubt. He’s the one who doesn’t belong. Getting rid of Checka was only to pull
wool over our eyes. What if—what if he follows orders from the other side?
Think about it. Oh, hi there!’ he almost shouted as he 
 saw Adda and Pelo
  standing in the 
 doorway.
  ‘I’m awfully sorry, 
 Feina,
  but we need to get going. It’s been a pleasure—Ricco—come, Pelo—I’m sure
we’ll see each other soon.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick grabbed his son, turned, and with quick steps walked down the 
 driveway.
  Feina’s forehead reorganised itself into a contemplative frown while her eyes
followed the back of Mr Slick’s balding head as it disappeared through the gates.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well,’ she said once the visitors were gone. She glanced at Ricco, and went
inside.</p>



<a name="b3c5"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book3.gif" class="img3"/></p><h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Adda, Feina and Ricco
  moved to 
 a one-bedroom flat
 on the ground floor of a converted pre-Saynian house far away from the Filehall
and the fashionable area of the city.
 It was all arranged by Mr Slick, who’d
made it very clear to them that under no circumstances should they move back
to their old house on Cable Street, for their own safety. At first, Ricco wanted
to give the room to Feina and her daughter, but he changed his mind when he received
a messenger from 
 Ina,
  and announced that he needed all the privacy he could get to continue their
sessions. Feina thought it was a good idea, too: the more Ricco stayed hidden
in the windowless inner room, the less likely it was that someone could recognise
them.
 With Adda, they set about turning the cast-iron cubicles into a home. They
ran antivirals on the kitchen; downloaded some new utensils; converted a tin
barrel into a comfortable fauteuil, and deleted all the silicon and copper dust
that had gathered on the shelves and the windowsills.
 They had to live plainly,
but, for the moment, they were free from the constant harassment of Milo’s agents.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco
  continued to spend hours with 
 Ina
  behind closed doors, supposedly meditating about the meaning of light, the oneness
of Exe, and the zeroness of the Washers. This was complemented by more and more
frequent (and surreptitious) visits by 
 Mr Slick.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You need to understand,’ Mr Slick’s voice stole through the door on one such
occasion, raspy with excitement, ‘that it was him! Not us, but Milo! And we need
to do everything we can to get back at him. In the name of Exe. Of course.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But why do you want to help me? Why are you on our side?’ Ricco asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m not on your side. I’m on the side of the truth. And you are on the side
of the truth, too.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And Milo?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, he’s too clever. Or, rather, uh, shifty.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, you’ve got to be shifty if you’re with, you know, the other side. Look how
quick he was to jump on the bandwagon when Mikke Beetemle was about to be released.
See? He’s one of them! If you ask me, this business with trying to demonise the
Washers and trying to convince everyone that they’re no more than symbols of
the evil inherent in all of us, or the emanations of the Universal Bad, or whatever,
is just nonsense. They are very much real and alive thanks very much on the other
side, and some of them are here!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco had an uneasy feeling that, actually, it wasn’t Milo who’d suggested that
the Washers weren’t entirely alive. But as Mr Slick sounded so convincing, he
quickly dismissed his doubts.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They way you put it, it’s so logical,’ he said. ‘We’re under threat!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But together, we can defeat them.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are you sure?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘If we can’t, who else can? And we simply must do it, in Exe’s name.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was a moment of silence.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’re right!’ Ricco shouted, full of zeal. ‘In Exe’s name!’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Mr Slick
  already had a plan. And its first step was to reconfigure
 Adda.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Listen to me,’ he told her as she was about to enter maintenance 
 mode in the basement of Mr Slick’s private residence.
  ‘Once this is done, you mustn’t tell anyone that you are you. Do you understand?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">She nodded.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick stooped over Adda, and smiled at her below the concrete ceiling. ‘You’ll
be more beautiful than ever.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda wasn’t sure how long the operation took. There must’ve been complications,
as her inner clock had been reset. But when she looked at herself in the mirror
the unlicensed 
 surgeon
  held over her, she couldn’t believe her eyes. She must’ve been the tiniest,
and therefore the most beautiful Frier on the planet.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Her new body was based on the latest designs. Her limbs had become even more
curved, gracefully completing her egg-shaped torso that was almost perfectly
spherical. They’d repainted her with the same colour, and shrunk her head to
the point that some of her processors had to be moved down into her chest.
  Feina
  and Mr Slick were standing next to her bed, wrapped in a white coat. ‘Don’t
forget,’ Slick told her, ‘not a word to anyone about who you are.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Not even Pelo?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Especially not Pelo.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda was silent for a second. ‘So who should I say I am?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We could only get you a new official name if we could hack into the Service,’
 Feina
  said. ‘But we’ll figure out something.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, hi, mum,’ Adda chirped, turning her head. ‘How do I look?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’re lovely,’ Feina told her, but Adda sensed a hint of fear in her mother’s
warm smile.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Adda and Feina
  decided to 
 target a short street lined with narrow two-storey houses
  just a block away from their new place. There was little chance that the robots
would recognise Feina, but, for safety’s sake, she wore the dress they’d bought
from the maid before they left the Filehall. Adda had to wear new clothes anyway.
Everything she’d got was way too large for her size, and they had no time to
reconfigure the dresses yet.</p>

<p class="pnorm">A cloud tinted the sunshine green, which turned the whole district into a miniature
emerald city. The green wasn’t easy on their eyes, and Adda only recognised a
tiny speck flying about in the distance in the last minute.</p>

<p class="pnorm">She grabbed Feina’s hand. ‘An agent!’ she whispered.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Feina tried to act natural. ‘Where?’ she whispered back.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘On the right, three houses away. Just above the dustbins.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Quickly, they looked around. There were two tiny trees. No alleys. Low fences
everywhere. There was nowhere to hide.</p>

<p class="pnorm">With a sudden movement, Feina grabbed Adda, whirled around, and jumped over the
gate of the nearest house. The agent was only about ten yards away when, after
some frantic 
 knocking, an old lady
  finally answered the door.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hi there,’ Feina said, pulling out a box of 
 cheap silicone cookies
  from her handbag. ‘We’ve just moved into the area and wanted to say hello. Can
we come in?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The face of the old lady lit up. ‘How kind of you! It’s always nice to have company.
And I’ve just made tea.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">She led them into the house, chatting continuously.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m 
 Agatha,
  by the way,’ she said as she put the teapot on a tray in her tiny, slightly
rusty kitchen that gave onto the street. ‘Sorry for the mess, but I didn’t expect
guests.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, that’s quite all right,’ Feina said, surreptitiously parting the curtains
with her hand to be able to peek out of the kitchen window. The agent passed
the house without stopping. ‘I’m Sona. It’s very nice to meet you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Likewise, likewise,’ Agatha said, dumping the cookies into a decorative bowl
made of copper coils. She turned to Adda. ‘And what’s your name, dear?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Adda,’ Adda replied without thinking. Then she looked at her mother, and added,
‘But with one <i>d.’</i></p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, how nice,’ Agatha said, preoccupied with the arrangement of the cookies.
She grabbed the bowl and the tray, and showed them into the living room.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The conversation swung between the weather and how nice it was to live in the
area. When they’d all agreed that the weather was much hotter than what it used
to be, Feina gave Adda the sign.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Talking of the weather,’ Adda started, ‘did you know that Milo Frier bought
a parasol because he couldn’t stand the Light?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Agatha’s eyes widened in surprise. ‘The head of the Secret Service?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, yes, yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘He can’t stand the Light? That’s some news! But how do you know?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda laughed. ‘You know what the Royal Post is like. They ended up delivering
the parasol to us.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And what did you do with it?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We sent it along, of course, to the right address. But,’ and here Adda paused
for effect, ‘we took a picture of it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Agatha was sitting on the edge of her chair. ‘You don’t happen to have it with
you, do you?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, what do you know,’ exclaimed Feina, who’d been rummaging in her handbag
ever since Adda mentioned the parasol. ‘I think I have it here.’ She produced
an instant-film hologram showing the parasol and a packing slip that clearly
indicated the buyer. The effect was incredible. Agatha could hardly believe her
eyes. With their work done, Feina and Adda took their leave, but as they were
walking towards the gate, Adda was almost knocked over by an old woman who’d
just turned out of the neighbouring garden, and, pushing them out of the way,
clonked her way to Agatha’s front door.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I just got your message, Agatha!’ she shouted while knocking frantically. ‘You
must be joking, right? Are you sure it was the Head of the Service? Oh, open
the door for bissake. So, was it really a parasol or what?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">This was not the only thing 
 the team of mother and daughter
  did. 
 A couple of blocks to the south,
  Adda
  explained to a retired accountant that Milo also had a little girl sent into
darkness.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The poor thing,’ exclaimed the accountant, ‘but who was she?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, you know,’ Adda said, quite consciously shifting from one foot to another,
‘just a friend of mine.’ She was on the verge of crying when she added, ‘It was
a very, very cruel thing to do.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">It didn’t take long before the rumours they’d started reached the Service. Confident
in his abilities in damage control, 
 Milo
  quickly had the canopy removed from above his head, and, to show how much he
cared for the younger generation, had a suggestion tabled that everyone in elementary
school should learn the account of the War of Lights by heart. What he couldn’t
foresee was that this drew the criticism of the students’ parents, who felt that
their children were already overwrought; and that the constant glitter from the
gilt on his skull would distract and anger bus drivers in the city.</p>

<p class="pnorm">During the next meeting in the 
 kitchen,
  Mr 
 Slick
  thanked Adda for her efforts, but everyone agreed that they needed to work harder
to discredit their enemy. A visit from their new neighbour came at the nick of
time. The middle-aged, bearded university 
 professor
  had been left with two tickets to the opera as his husband had suddenly decided
that he wasn’t interested in seeing, for the umpteenth time, the fiery extravaganza
they were showing. So, the professor dropped by, introduced himself, and asked
if anyone would like to go with him.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m sure you would love to go,’ Mr Slick smiled at Adda, and nodded almost imperceptibly.
The next thing Adda knew was that she was sitting in the 
 stalls,
  pretending to enjoy the flame-studded visual overload that she’d also had the
misfortune to sit through numerous times as a slightly bigger, VIP herself. Back
then, she could hardly wait for the intermission so that she could get a scoop
of the opera’s signature frozen bromine. Now she dreaded the moment when the
curtains would fall. When it finally happened, she gathered all her strength,
went over her lines in her head, and, as Mr Slick instructed, dragged the professor
into the crowd that had congregated around the bar, even though the professor
had repeatedly excused himself for not having enough money to buy anything there.
She held her head high, like a real lady, and, with a slightly raised voice,
struck up a conversation.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, who knows what made him screw his head onto that building,’ she began,
gleaming in her tastefully re-tailored 
 mirror dress.
  ‘I find it rather strange.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Can’t we talk about something else?’ whispered the professor, slightly embarrassed.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, you don’t think so? Well, here’s what <i>I</i> think. I think he did that
because he feels insecure. Because he doesn’t really know how to manage the Secret
Service. Let alone something bigger.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’re making a scene,’ the professor hissed, already as red as the new national
flag.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But as more robots turned to listen, Adda seemed to be getting carried away.
‘And it’s no wonder he’s seen as a weak leader. He says he’s after the Washers,
but—now, of course, this is just hearsay—he’s said not to have caught any.
On the contrary! He keeps the ones already in prison pretty well, and regularly
throws black-light parties at our expense. Did you know that the budget of the
Service is already 3.14159 times as much as what it was under Sayn? And now,
if you’ll excuse me,’ she leaned closer to the professor, ‘I’ll go and put some
powder on my nose.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">She’d expected to feel bad, but, instead, she felt strong. Strong and strangely
amused. She knew she shouldn’t be smiling, but the relief was so immense that
she couldn’t help herself. She bent her head down to try to hide it. It was in
the reflective surface of her skirt that she saw the face. It was 
 Lauda.
  Adda stopped. Had the woman recognised her? Had the dress given her away, despite
the careful miniaturisation? Had she heard what she’d said? Maybe she hadn’t.
Maybe she had. At once, Adda realised that it didn’t matter. The important thing
was not to give Lauda another chance. She had to leave at once.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You can go,’ the professor said, clearly annoyed, ‘but as for me, I would like
to see the second act, if you don’t mind.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Please,’ Adda pleaded, ‘it would be too suspicious if I left alone.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Maybe you can throw another of your tantrums, and we could pretend to have a
fight. Then you can yell something at me and walk out without your coat. Isn’t
that what women are supposed to do?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Not a bad idea, but it would discredit me.’ Adda cast a quick glance around.
‘Please. It’s very important.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">She could see that the professor was checking the time on his internal clock.
He had just opened his mouth to reply, when Lauda appeared in the doorway of
the corridor leading to the little rooms. Adda looked there. Their eyes met.
Adda resisted the instinct to turn her head away too suddenly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We need to go. Now,’ she whispered, staring blankly ahead as if she hadn’t seen
Lauda at all.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’ll get the coats from the cloakroom,’ whispered the professor. Then, quite
loudly, he added, ‘I’ll be just a minute, darling!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda was too nervous to smile. ‘Thanks,’ she said. ‘I’ll wait outside.’ And walked
out.</p>

<p class="pnorm">She wasn’t sure, but she thought she saw Lauda going to the cloakroom as well.
It was too dangerous to stand just next to the entrance, so she decided to walk
around the building. There were fewer cars and more pedestrians than at the beginning
of the performance. The sun was white and fierce. Adda focused on her steps.
She wanted to walk naturally. Neither too fast, nor too slow. She met the professor
when she reached the fourth corner of the opera house.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I thought you’d walk around the block,’ he said. ‘Here’s your coat. Give me
your arm. That woman is following us.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Let’s go.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Who’s she?’ the professor asked, as they tried to make their way toward Occam’s
Circuit in the crowd.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Someone who thinks I’m someone she knows.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are you that someone?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I was.’ After a while, she added, ‘Let it suffice that she’s wrong, and I’m
right.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">They mingled with the crowd, went into a dozen high-street shops, smithies, and
light bars until they were confident that they’d lost her.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well,’ the 
 professor
  grinned, ‘that certainly was more interesting than the opera. Boy, I could do
with some refreshment. Mind if we go in?’ he indicated 
 a pub
  they’d just passed.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, not at all. I’m… extremely grateful for your help.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The pub was in a one-storey metal box let to rust in an attempt to create an
air of authenticity. Its interior was a hodgepodge of everything copper or bronze;
bells, pipes, coins and wires gleamed on the walls and the ceiling in the sunlight
augmented by fluorescent windows. It was packed with robots basking in the light,
gulping down coulombs of static charge.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Uh, pardon, Miss,’ bellowed a robot who bumped his knee into 
 Adda.
  Adda looked up, but didn’t dare to answer. The robot was 
 Pelo,
  and she couldn’t let him recognise her voice. She only nodded when the professor
asked her if she wanted a drink, and sat on a barstool close to Pelo to hear
what he was talking about.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was clear that he’d taken too much charge already. His processors couldn’t
cope with the flood of electrons, and he started to slur his speech. Some claimed
the overabundance of current amplified the hidden thoughts, and, therefore, the
robots said what they really thought in this state. Others insisted on the opposite:
that it made the processors skip certain commands, which simply made the robots
stupid. Adda seriously hoped the latter was true.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’ll tell ya one thin. You hear me? One thin!’ Pelo bawled, punching another
robot in the shoulder. ‘This whole messenger business is, is a load of crap.
Look at me! I didn’t declare them. Ya know wha’ I did? I s… sent them the
whole hive, that’s what. All that crap in a big fuckin’ envelope. They know what
they can do with it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hey, keep it down!’ shouted the bartender. ‘You’ll get yourself in trouble.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Me?’ asked Pelo, opening his arms and smiling. ‘What ca’they do? I… I knew
a girl who lost everything because of them. The messengers. I thought I could
help ’er.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What’s happened to the bird?’ his mate asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘She’s gone. Good for her. I don really care, to be honest. At least she don
see this shit we’re in. Thanks to the big shots. They’re so fucked reading all
our messengers they fucked the whole shit up.’ He checked his pockets, and turned
to a taller robot. ‘Hey, be a good boy and buy me a drink. I’ll pay it back tomorrow.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Not another one,’ the friend protested.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘C’mon, you know who my old man is.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’re never gonna pay it back.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Pelo grabbed him by the collar. ‘Now listen, pal. I’m new. You’re old. We can
make something of it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Two guards grabbed Pelo, and threw him out. He landed on the concrete pavement
with a loud bang.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m sorry for this,’ the professor said. ‘I didn’t know there was a clown in
here. Do you want to go?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No,’ Adda replied, without looking up. ‘I’m OK.’</p>



<a name="b3c6"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book3.gif" class="img3"/></p><h1>Chapter 6</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">But 
 Adda’s and the professor’s
  troubles weren’t over. When they got home, the professor’s 
 husband,
  who himself had just got back from the local pub, was beside himself with worry,
frustration, and anger. Their house had been broken into. Their papers and books
strewn all over the floor; the cabinets smashed and emptied, the computers taken
apart. There was nothing missing, as far as they could tell.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco
  and 
 Feina
  were already there, trying to offer help and support. The professor realised
in an instant who was behind the seeming burglary.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m sure what you’re doing is right,’ he told Adda and 
 Ricco,
  standing in front of their unhinged front door, ‘and I sincerely wish you the
strength to carry on. But I’m sure you’ll understand that we’d like to be left
out of it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m not sure what you’re talking about,’ Ricco said, but he was phenomenally
bad at playing the innocent.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We do,’ Adda interposed quickly, ‘and we’re terribly sorry. And thanks again
for saving me earlier.’ Not being able to do anything else, she smiled at the
professor, and left without looking at Ricco.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">It seemed it’d been worth the trouble. The rumours 
 Adda
  had planted were spreading like viruses. All one needed to do was to open a
messenger from an infected friend or relative, and one was immediately weakened
by the remote possibility that the speculations had some truth to them. And the
little team, 
 Adda, Feina, Ricco, and Mr Slick,
  had no intention to stop what they’d named Operation Victor.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We can’t go too far,’ Mr Slick thundered in their underground headquarters,
otherwise serving as 
 the kitchen of Adda’s home.
  ‘This is a war of minds, and, as long as it’s not physical, there’s nothing
we can’t, mustn’t, or shouldn’t do to win others over. Exe is on our side.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And Milo is not only on the other side,’ Adda raised to speak with flushed cheeks,
‘but is actually controlled by it!’ She was extremely satisfied with herself
because of the success of her latest mission, and she’d been taking a bigger
and bigger part in concocting the next rumours—or, as they put it, in discovering
new truths.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Excellent!’ said Mr Slick. ‘If we find the right wording, this can be a big
one.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘In Exe’s name!’ cheered Adda. There were an increasing number of robots who
followed them. And so many could not be wrong.</p>

<p class="pnorm">In a few hours, and in an attempt to reach as wide an audience as possible, Mr
Slick and Ricco released a bag of spam messengers. Their contents explained that
the real reason why Milo severed his own head was that he’d made a pact with
Luxophobe. Milo, it was suggested, had agreed to give his body to Luxophobe in
return for some otherworldly help in becoming the Head of the Royal Secret Service.
(This was Feina’s contribution.) And could one ask for a better proof than the
fact that he had become the Head?</p>

<p class="pnorm">Milo
  did try to launch a counter-attack, but Mr 
 Slick
  designed the accusations in a way that any rebuttal only made things worse.
Everything backfired on Milo. He tried to catch some Washers, but they all turned
out to be innocent Friers, respectable pillars of local communities; and the
Service was forced to let them go and issue a long series of apologies. To point
out how ridiculous the claim was that his body had been taken to the underworld,
he had it recovered from the junkyard and displayed in a glass coffin in the
entrance hall of the Service. Not many went to see it, and the newspapers were
poking fun at the headless cadaver for weeks, calling its exhibition the worst
case of self-glorification in generations.</p>

<p class="pnorm">This only helped the rumour about Milo and Luxophobe to spread, and soon it completed
a round trip around the kingdom. It’d grown and matured considerably by the time
it got back. With that unquestionable authority that only comes with age, it
now declared that the body was, in fact, Milo’s second payment to the Washer
god. Before that, Luxophobe had demanded a virgin to be delivered to the entrance
of a cave right in the basement of the Headquarters of the Service. There must,
the rumour went on, tapping the side of its nose, be a horrible secret hidden
there—why would they protect the Headquarters that much otherwise?</p>

<p class="pnorm">Of course, no one knew <i>for sure.</i> But how could’ve someone come up with
such a fantastic story as this, hadn’t it been based on the truth? And if part
of it <i>was</i> true, wouldn’t that make Adda the one who first suggested,
in an inspired moment, that Milo not only cooperated with, but had actually put
himself in the hands of Mumha and Luxophobe?</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But how did you know?’ 
 Ina,
  during one of her 
 visits to the Friers’
  as a now active participant in Operation Victor, insisted asking her for the
third time.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda
  just stood there, next to the 
 sink,
  with a face as red as an error code. ‘I don’t know.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Of course you don’t, of course!’ Ina said in a high-pitched voice, raising her
arms in the air. ‘Because it was suggested to you—by Higher Powers. You’ve
been chosen, Adda.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I have?’ Adda said, with her eyes looking into the distance. She truly didn’t
know how she knew it. But the rumour—it must be true. And she just might know
things that others didn’t. She felt herself big; bigger even than before the
reduction. She finally knew what her purpose was. She’d been chosen.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But—but one shouldn’t think like that. One mustn’t believe that one was more
than her fellow beings. Adda realised she needed more strength to live with the
burden of this new gift, this new task, and remain humble of heart, and obedient
in her soul.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘In Exe’s name,’ she whispered, and ran into the room.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">And then, it happened. The sun started to sway so much that it finally dipped
below the horizon. For a couple of seconds, the sky darkened; the shadows grew
so long that they blended into a thin purple veil that obscured the kingdom.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The Friers
  watched in horror as the general brightness of the sky was reduced to a spray
of twinkling spots.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Exe has spoken,’ they said, ‘and the Washers are upon us. We have sinned, and
our leaders are corrupt and aluxic.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">And, as Ricco had already resigned, that meant Milo.</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was only one robot who didn’t think that the temporary darkness was a punishment—Mr
 Godnor.
  He thought that the sun disappeared below the horizon because from their point
of view, it seemed to disappear below the horizon, without any intent or meaning.
In fact, he’d expected this to happen for a long time based on his tables full
of celestial measurements. But he knew better than to join Milo in insisting
that this had no significance at all, or, if it had, it wasn’t what everyone
thought. All he said was that it was going to get worse before it got better.
And that was precisely what happened.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Milo,
  on the other hand, was busy finding an excuse for what appeared to be the end
of the world. He had posters put up, anonymously, that professed that it was
all Sayn’s fault; and someone, who happened to be the wife of a high-ranking
agent at the Service, launched a petition asking the Elders to posthumously dethrone
the King. About five dozen robots signed the document, but it was clear it was
never going to happen, for quite obvious reasons.</p>



<a name="b3c7"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book3.gif" class="img3"/></p><h1>Chapter 7</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Robots standing on street corners, on top of empty oil barrels, shouting into
megaphones or throwing messengers at pedestrians had become common sights. They
were desperate to warn their fellow Friers about the impending doom, and urge
them to do everything they could to please Exe, the God of Light. Some started
to sell personal jetpacks for a nominal amount to help everyone escape the destruction
of the planet. It wasn’t known what happened to the robots who bought one, sold
their homes, closed their bank accounts, gave away everything, lifted off, and
drifted into the depths of space carried by the solar winds, but many regarded
them as the most fortunate ones.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But 
 Adda
  didn’t lose hope. Assuming the identity of a poor single-core country girl who’d
just arrived in the city, she took on herself to explain that if all Friers united
against Luxophobe and his followers, they could show their worthiness, and Exe
would return to them.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We must not forget for a moment,’ 
 she
  would say, ‘that we all belong to Exe; we emanated from Him, and to Him we will
return. The periods of darkness are short, which means He has not rejected us,
but is disappointed that we’ve allowed the Evil to infiltrate our ranks. If we
do not act, these periods will grow longer and longer until they meet, end-to-end,
and there will be no photons to see, no infrared wave to heat up the ground,
and no electron to live on. The air itself will freeze into enormous crystals,
which will fall from the sky for a hundred hours, shattering the crust of the
planet as they hit the ground until the planet itself collapses. Those who survive
the first few seconds of this will quickly discharge, and their bodies will be
crushed by the splinters of our destroyed world.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Then, 
 Adda
  set about to 
 organise processions through the city to
  show the Friers’ unity and determination both to the doubting robots and to
the celestial powers. They lit tiny incandescent lamps, and prayed during the
periods of darkness.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You see how much damage the one who affiliated with Luxophobe has caused,’ 
 she said during an impromptu speech
  in Screen Park to her flock in the middle of one such period, which was unusually
long, and unusually dark. They nodded in agreement. Although it had never been
stated publicly, they all knew whom she meant.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hold your lamps above your heads!’ she fired them.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But then, out of nowhere, six 
 or eight tiny agents
  appeared, each with a blindingly bright, sputtering arc light.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’re here to help you fight the darkness,’ one of them said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda
  stepped forward to meet them. Her fear that the agents might recognise her had
long disappeared. ‘Who sent you?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Milo Frier himself.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We don’t want your lights. You might as well leave.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">An agent, fluttering his wings a bit, pointed at the yellowish bulb Adda held
in her hand. ‘But ours are brighter than the ones you’ve got.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Exactly. The real light comes from within. Now go away. You ooze darkness.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Watch your mouth. You know that accusing an agent of being aluxic is treason.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I said you ooze darkness. I didn’t say you were aluxic. Now leave us alone.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s the same thing,’ the agent insisted.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda lost her temper. ‘Well, what if you <i>are</i> aluxic! You work for the
disciple of Luxophobe and Mumha himself!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The agent grabbed Adda’s thin arm. ‘I will have to ask you to come with us. You
are under arrest.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">But Adda was still too heavy for one agent, and the others couldn’t get a grip
on her spherical body.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Look out!’ 
 someone
  shrieked as the agents struggled with the girl. It was 
 Ina;
  she came running from across the entrance of the park. She spotted what Adda
couldn’t see: that one of the agents pulled out a sparker. The 
 Friers
  around Adda came to their senses.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Take this, snitch!’ shouted one of them as he knocked the agent with the gun
down.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But the rest of the agents managed to lift Adda off the ground.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Put me down!’ she kicked about. ‘You’ve got no right! You’ve got no warrant!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ina leaped forward, jumped up in the air, and grabbed her legs.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Come on!’ she urged the Friers. ‘Don’t let them take her away!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">More and more robots pressed around her. Some grabbed her arms; others caught
Adda’s feet to prevent the agents from carrying her away.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Let her go now!’ bellowed an agent, pulling at Adda’s hair furiously. ‘Resisting
an officer of the Service constitutes treason!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And you constitute darkness!’ a Frier shouted back.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The agent with the sparker was coming round, but a robot standing next to him
kicked him so hard one of his wings broke off.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Suddenly, the agents let Adda go, and she landed on the dusty ground with a terrible
clatter. Her side got dented, and Ina landed on top of her. The agents grabbed
their wounded comrade, and disappeared among the clouds.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are you OK?’ Ina asked Adda.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda looked at her meaningfully. ‘Oh thank you, kind stranger, for saving me,’
she said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Not at all,’ Ina winked. ‘So what do we do now?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">But they didn’t have much time to contemplate. With their sirens wailing, two
 police
  vans appeared screeching on the meandering path that crossed the park. About
twenty 
 officers
  jumped out of them, and forced the little group against a railing.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We don’t want any trouble here,’ a 
 policeman
  said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They were still as large as at the time of the Battle, as the police were exempt
from the obligatory miniaturisation. In their occupation, size probably mattered.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hey, you!’ he pointed at Adda.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes?’ Adda asked back defiantly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Come here.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda did so with a light limp, and looked the officer in the eye.</p>

<p class="pnorm">A second passed in silence.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hey! You’ve go no right to do this! I will&nbsp;–,’ Adda cried, then suddenly fell
silent.</p>

<p class="pnorm">A moment later, the officer turned away.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Heh,’ he said, then beckoned the others. ‘Come on, boys, let’s go. And as for
you lot, go home, and keep low if you don’t want to end up inside.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’ll be back!’ shouted a robot as the sun re-appeared above the horizon. The
officers got back into the vans, and drove away.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ina put her arm around Adda’s shoulder.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What happened?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They logged in.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And what did they find?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You know what they found.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">A couple of hours later, 
 Ina, Adda, and her robots were back.
  And so were the 
 police.
  The police, in fact, had been preparing for the eventuality of another civil
unrest ever since the Friers took power, but their usual strategy merely consisted
of turning out in great numbers and hoping to deter other robots from joining
the demonstration. This, expectedly, had had the opposite effect, and Feina and
Mr Slick had no trouble recruiting robots from all corners of the kingdom for
their cause. They hired trucks, and transported them to the capital to join Adda
 in front of the Royal Palace,
  where Adda was already busy preaching that the establishment was against the
robots, and therefore against truth and Exe himself.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The crowd around her quickly swelled to tens of thousands.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda climbed on top of the 
 Gate of Flames.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’re here to demand the resignation of everyone in power!’ she continued. ‘It
is clear that they stand in the way of our path back to Exe, back to the Light!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Resign!’ answered the crowd.</p>

<p class="pnorm">She saw the police forming ranks in the nearby streets. ‘They’re here!’ she screamed.
‘Don’t let them tell you that all they want is to restore order!’ she continued
as the police moved closer and slowly surrounded them. ‘Why would they want to
send us home? We’ve got a right to be here. They are not with us; they are not
with Exe!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ina
  was at the back, facing a constable trying to make them move away from the Palace.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We won’t move! Leave us alone!’ she shouted, and hit his shield with her fist.
The constable pulled out his baton.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t you dare hit her!’ 
 hissed a robot
  next to Ina. Others joined in, and thronged there to see what was happening.
‘Did he hit her?’ they asked. ‘Did they hit a woman?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">A nearby sergeant nodded, and twenty policemen stepped back, preparing for a
charge.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Who are you protecting? We’re on your side! Look at the sky, dumbhead!’ the
protesters shouted. ‘Why don’t you join us?’ Ina added, at the top of her voice.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Move!’ roared the sergeant at them. The protesters didn’t budge.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Move!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Two seconds passed.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Go!’ he shouted, and his section ran forward ready to hit anyone in their path.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The Friers parted, and the crowd swallowed the 
 constable
  running at the front. It grabbed him with a hundred arms, dragged him down,
and closed up immediately. He was pushed against the ground, hit and kicked repeatedly,
until his neck loosened, his breastplate ripped open, and his torso opened up.
From the hole in his abdomen, a pair of eyes was peeking out. The robots quickly
tore to pieces what turned out to be a mere shell to pull out four trembling
winged agents from the policeman’s body.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The discovery rippled through the crowd.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘This is not the police! This is the army of the Service!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Maybe,’ someone added, ‘the police don’t even exist anymore.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was a general uproar. Astonishment, terror and rage united the robots,
and from the chaos, an organised army of intrepid fighters emerged. They broke
the chain of policemen, trampled on the constables and crushed the sergeants
killing the agents trapped inside them, and 
 marched to the headquarters of the Royal Secret Service.
  The crowd filled the square in front of the building; overflowed into the neighbouring
streets as far as Power Bridge, and brought the traffic to a standstill in the
East side of the city. At the headquarters, they were met by about a thousand
officers, but not one of them was armed.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hear us out,’ their leader pleaded. 
 Adda and Ina
  made their way from the middle of the crowd to meet them.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘There’s been a misunderstanding,’ 
 the leader
  said. ‘We are afraid of the darkness, too, and we’d also like Exe to return
to us. You tell us what we need to do.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ina
  couldn’t believe her ears. ‘Now this is something, isn’t it?’ she laughed.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But Adda’s
  eyes narrowed, and she only spoke after a short pause. ‘Maybe it would be better
if you’d try to join us.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Murmuring hardly audibly, the crowd parted to let the newcomers in. Some eyed
them in suspicion, but the more open-minded ones stepped forward and shook their
hands. Adda mounted an empty oil barrel. Everyone turned to face her. She was
alone between the headquarters and her robots, and could hardly look up to face
them, as the rising sun shone on her blindingly from the East.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘First of all,’ she began, ‘please give a warm round of applause to those who
have just joined us. I think this is an important step, and the most important
victory we’ve scored so far.’ The protesters responded with muted applause. ‘A
moment ago you asked me what you needed to do. As I’ve said before, I’ll say
it again: the road we need to take seems to me quite simple, yet difficult. There
is a traitor in this country. We must show him for what he is, so that Exe would
see that we are worthy of his Light.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well put, well put!’ shouted 
 Milo’s head
  from above. His voice echoed down the aluminium and copper tubes. ‘There is
indeed a traitor, or, rather, traitors. They are Pattero and his son.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, they are not,’ protested 
 Adda,
  suddenly realising the mistake she’d made.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s understandable that you are partial in this,’ Milo continued, ‘as you’re
quite closely related to Ricco. But I know you’re better than that, Adda.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Suddenly, the robots fell quiet. Adda didn’t dare to look up. She’d gone to great
lengths to keep it a secret who she really was. But as she didn’t want to lie,
either, she’d decided to avoid mentioning her name or origins, which turned out
to be more difficult to implement than she’d first thought. Now she tried to
guess what the reaction of her followers was to the revelation of her true identity,
but there was little to infer from the silence. The sun was strong again; harsh,
merciless light poured down from the sky.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Milo continued as if he hadn’t realised or cared about the effect of what he’d
said. ‘We both seek the truth and the truth alone. It is clear that either I
am the traitor, or them. But who do you think is the more likely candidate for
an aluxic: the one who has always striven to cleanse the kingdom of the Washers
and their evil influence, or the ones who have continuously failed to do so,
and even resigned before their failure could’ve become blindingly obvious?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘There might be something in that, you know,’ a police officer in the crowd said
to the robots around him.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You say it’s me,’ Milo went on, ‘I say not so fast, it might not be me. It’s
your word against mine.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Before Adda could’ve replied, his sister, 
 Lauda
  appeared walking leisurely out of the main entrance of the building.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How ya doing?’ she asked, and went up to 
 Ina
  with arms akimbo.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t you dare come here,’ Ina hissed between her teeth.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda tried to focus on Milo. ‘Exactly,’ she said, ‘one robot against another.
I don’t think anyone will have any difficulty making up their minds about who
is right.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, you know, I happen to agree with Milo,’ Lauda said. ‘Now it’s two against
one.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda couldn’t help but laugh. ‘Excuse me, but I fail to see what difference that
makes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Ooh,’ Lauda said, ‘so we’ve become so arrogant that we think we alone can be
right, be the sole conveyor of the truth, haven’t we?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda’s face flushed. ‘No, I&nbsp;–,’ she started, but Ina interrupted her.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I agree with Adda. Now it’s two against two.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Very good,’ Milo’s voice resounded.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda turned to face him. ‘I don’t think you can achieve anything this way.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, don’t worry,’ Milo boomed, ‘you’ll see how much we’ve achieved.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He was right. 
 Some robots
  in the crowd started to scratch their heads, shift from one leg to another,
and glanced toward the bridge from where they had come. Others began to discuss
the developments quite loudly, no longer paying any attention to Adda or even
to Milo.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Let’s get all of them!’ a woman shouted hysterically. ‘That way we can be sure
we’ve killed the traitor!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Kill all leaders! Kill all leaders!’ some chanted, but their voice quickly died
away. The woman herself was hushed down.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Calm down, there’s no point,’ a tiny robot told her. ‘Can’t you see? We’re all
being used here. No one cares about Exe or Luxophobe. It’s Ricco’s and Milo’s
business, and nothing else. I’m going home.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">And with that, he turned and disappeared among the telescopic legs and metal
bodies of various shapes and sizes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It didn’t take half an hour for the square to become completely deserted. 
 Ina
  had disappeared as well. Adda knew she had to be the last one to leave, so she
ambled behind the last group of protesters, keeping a couple of steps’ distance.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘This can’t go on,’ one of them said. ‘We need to do something.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But what? I hate Milo, and I don’t trust that girl, either.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Shut up!’ another hissed. ‘She’s just behind us.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda
  heard a shout. She turned around. A 
 group of teenagers
  emerged from an alley, running toward the headquarters.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Fuckers! Fuckers!’ they kept shouting, waving USB sticks above their heads.
They fell on the two guards, who didn’t even have time to cry out; their mutilated
parts, circuits and discs were ripped apart and scattered across the square.
Then, with surprising speed, they set about forcing the entrance open, while
one of them mounted the pipes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda, having lost all faith that anything could be done to defeat Milo, was mesmerised
by this heroism. Her whole being focused on that one robot as he was climbing
higher and higher. He was about halfway between the ground and the Head, when
an arm reached out of an opening in the wall holding a sparker.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘On the left! On the left!’ she yelled, but it was too late. She heard the faint
buzz of the spark, hardly visible in the scorching sunlight. The robot stopped;
his grip on the pipe loosened, and, in complete silence, he tumbled to the ground.
Adda caught a glimpse of his face as the falling body hit a protruding hook.
It was 
 Pelo.</p>



<a name="b3c8"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book3.gif" class="img3"/></p><h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">‘It’s all your fault!’ 
 Ricco
  said to 
 Adda
  as he paced the floor of their tiny 
 kitchen,
  kicking the empty pans in his way. Adda was 
 sitting
  patiently on a stool, and 
 Feina
  watched him from the door of the room. She kept reliving the recent events,
and could hardly get herself to have some rest.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco went on ranting. ‘I’m sure you did this deliberately. Hope you’re happy!
They’re all after me now!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t think so,’ Adda said calmly, but immediately regretted it.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How would <i>you </i>know?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I was <i>out</i> there.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The rhythm of a pre-arranged knock sounded on the doorpost.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Finally,’ Ricco said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Feina
  opened the door. ‘Oh, 
 Mr Slick,
  do come in,’ she said, as 
 a shiny, bald head
  appeared in the doorway. ‘Would you like something to drink? We’re all so terribly
sorry about what happened. Please accept our deepest sympathy.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you,’ Mr Slick said, and took a seat at the kitchen table. ‘Some charge
would be nice, thank you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Any news?’ Ricco asked him.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Plenty,’ Mr Slick said, then nodded towards Feina as he took the slightly rusty
Leyden jar full of electrons. ‘But none too good. Milo has just announced, unsurprisingly,
that he’d oppose any expeditions to the other hemisphere as it would, as he put
it, interfere with the order of the world as Exe created it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco looked puzzled. ‘I don’t understand. I thought he didn’t care about Exe.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s just shorthand for his fear that the robots might discover what’s really
there.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, Hell is there, with water, ice, and the Washers.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Possibly,’ Mr Slick took a sip from the jar, ‘but we happen think there’s a
bit of oil as well.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco wasn’t sure what Mr Slick meant—it was in all likelihood a coded, metaphorical
statement. In the end, he said, ‘Oh,’ and asked if there was any other news,
closer to home.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Everyone out there is quite wound up. They’re afraid of the darknesses, but
they aren’t sure what they should do about them. I think we’ve made a lot of
progress.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But they want to kill everyone who had been in a higher position at any time
during the last decade! There’s that woman out there telling the robots to get
rid of the whole aristocracy as we speak!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Ina?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes. Apparently, she’s had the truth revealed to her. Father, Mr Godnor, and
the other two had to be transported to a castle outside the capital in disguise.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You see? They’re not afraid of Milo any more. They hate him, and are pretty
close to rising up and ousting him for good.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But they also want to kill me! I’ll get lynched the moment I stick my head out
of the door!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Now that’s unfortunate, but not the end of the world.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t think you understood what I’ve just said.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh I did alright. They want to kill you. That’s easy to fix.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Really? How?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Now,’ Mr Slick said slowly as he put his hands together, carefully aligning
his fingertips, ‘when I say easy, what I mean is easy—for me. I’ve got a fail-safe
plan. But it’s going to make it necessary to commit myself to you publicly, and
there’s something that I think would make this go down well.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What is it?’ Feina asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I,’ Mr Slick started, then stopped. He seemed to be struggling with himself.
‘I, if Adda could be my companion, it would make me a natural ally in the eyes
of the public.’ There was a stunned silence. ‘But also on a personal level,’
Mr Slick continued quickly, ‘I have never met anyone more intelligent, determined,
and, not least of all, beautiful, than you, Adda. The recent events made me realise
that I’m only one man, after all. I’ve always wanted to have children, but I
couldn’t dedicate enough time to raise them the way they should be. I think the
two of us could build the most advanced children in the kingdom.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">No one dared to break the silence. Then, Feina said, ‘What do you say, Adda?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">If there’d been an Exe this side of the Great Void, surely the iron ceiling of
the tiny kitchen would’ve melted, and the ruins of the pre-Sayn house would’ve
buried their bodies forever. But nothing happened; only Adda was shaking visibly
as the awful truth had dawned on her. She had been reduced to nothing. Her mind
had been persuaded to fight for something that did not help her now. And the
reason her body had been reconfigured was not for camouflage; it was so that
she’d be more pleasing to Mr Slick’s eye. She’d become his invention long before
she knew it.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m not sure what to say,’ she finally said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘To be honest,’ Ricco said, ‘I’m surprised at you, Slick. I mean Adda is so young.
It just doesn’t sound right.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Did I mention that once Milo is out of the way, there’s nothing that would stop
you from becoming King?’ Mr Slick added offhandedly.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’re all in danger,’ concluded Ricco, ‘and we don’t have much of a choice.
And if Adda doesn’t object…’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Adda?’ Feina asked her daughter.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda looked up. Her eyes were distant and indifferent.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I really don’t know,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh for Exessake,’ Ricco burst out, ‘this is the best thing that could’ve happened
to us! We moved here to protect you, I resigned to protect you, now show us some
gratitude!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda’s face reddened. ‘It was me who went out there and tried to do something
while you were lying on the sofa! I risked my life to get rid of Milo and help
you!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And you fucked the whole thing up! Because you couldn’t follow the plan!’</p>

<p class="pnorm"><i>‘I </i>always did what I was told!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Then why make an exception now? Show me you don’t love Cynd and marry Mr Slick,
and we’ll call it even.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda looked at Ricco, than her mother. Then, after a short pause, she said, ‘Well,
thanks for this. Thank you, Mr Slick, for your kind words. Hateful words in the
guise of kindness still mean kindness, and show some care. And I’m thankful,’
she turned to the other two, ‘for the hate, because that shows a special kind
of care, which, somewhere deep down, might even mean love.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick smiled. ‘Charming chop-logic, as usual.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, let’s get over with the ceremony ASAP,’ Feina said, ‘and we’ll see how
it works out. Worse things have happened.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick now talked business. ‘I’ve got a couple of hours free on week forty-one.
There’d be nothing big, just a friend or two—I’ve just lost Pelo, as you know,
and it wouldn’t look good if I threw a party or something.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What week is this?’ Ricco asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Forty.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Forty! Well, next week is too soon. We still need to do some preparations. Let
it be forty-two.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Forty-two it is, then,’ Mr Slick agreed. ‘I wish it would be just hours away.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">With the matrimonial arrangements out of the way, Mr Slick’s plan sprung into
action. For the time of the next darkness (which he obtained from Mr Godnor),
he had a 
 rally organised in front of the Gate of Flames and the Royal Palace.
  There was also a small but high stage erected in front of the Gate, just large
enough so that 
 Adda, Feina and Ricco
  could sit behind it, hidden from the crowd. A powerful sound system and some
spectacular lighting completed the set-up. Mr 
 Slick
  himself appeared in an awe-inspiring halo of light in front of the thousands
who’d gathered.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He tapped the microphone, and said ‘One, two three’ apparently pretty nervously
a couple of times.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Can you hear me?’ his voice resounded. It was far too loud, and sounded as if
it reached even the outskirts of the capital.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Some shouted ‘yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, yes, sorry for the strong lights, but I thought it’d be better if you
saw me. Ahem. So, as you know, I don’t appear publicly too often, but I’ve made
an exception this time because of a personal loss, and a surprising discovery,
and I thought here, together, we might decide what to do about them.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Just like you, I was also quite disappointed in our leaders, and convinced that
as long as they were here, we wouldn’t be able to solve the moral crisis our
kingdom had been pushed into. However, I had to focus on keeping my company afloat
in this turmoil, so that the hundreds who work for Monopoil would have secure
jobs, secure income, and a secure future. And then, I was told the saddest of
news one can ever hear—my son was dead.’ He paused. ‘He died a death fit for
heroes. Just a handful of boys, fired by their inherent understanding of justice
and truth, and seeing that you’d all turned your backs on the cause, attempted
to break into the headquarters of the Royal Secret Service. They did not have
a chance.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He stopped, and turned away. Then, after a couple of seconds, faced the robots
again, and continued.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t know why he did it. But the years have taught me that heroism on this
scale can never be based on lies and deceit. Heroes are always right.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I was troubled by this. My son knew Adda Frier. He looked up on her, and respected
her. He could’ve gotten to Ricco through her easily. Yet he went for Milo. But
why? Could there be, can there be a difference between these leaders?</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I personally collected whatever was available about Milo and Ricco. I combed
through the archives of the newscloud. There was a lot of mud throwing, all right,
but nothing that would show whether one was better than the other. I dug deeper.
And that’s when I found a memo of the Service, one that was numbered 271828.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It detailed, and I’m not making this up, how the Service planned use misinformation
to discredit Ricco, Adda, and Feina Frier; and cast doubt on their faith and
integrity. And they were quite successful in this. Why? Because they had a powerful
ally—Luxophobe. Everything we suspected about Milo and the Service, the cave,
the secret pact, is true. It’s all there in the memo.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda, sitting silently on a small bench behind the stage, looked up at the dark
grey swirling clouds. Her mother buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I rushed to Ricco with this paper,’ Mr Slick continued. ‘As you can imagine,
he was delighted to see such a tangible proof of Milo’s machinations. He was
close to exposing Milo himself. You thought that he’d resigned to hide his Washer
connections and save himself from your anger, right? Wrong. He resigned to be
able to work behind the scenes and bring Milo to justice.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The robots looked at each other, and 
 Ina,
  who was standing at the front, folded her arms.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick went on. He extended his arms towards the back, and said, ‘Let me call
to the stage Adda, Feina and Ricco!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco stood up slowly and mechanically. Feina and Adda followed him without a
word. As they mounted the steps to the stage, Feina looked at Adda.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Once this is over&nbsp;–,’ she started, but Adda looked at her, and she fell silent.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They were greeted with muted applause, which was cut short by a voice so loud
it made even Mr Slick wince.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What a nice bunch of crooks!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was 
 Milo;
  he used his building as a sound box to make himself heard. His voice engulfed
the city as it moved from the South of the river all the way up to the Palace.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick, cranking up the volume on his own sound system, was quick to reply.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Look who’s got the brass to tune in,’ he said, forcing a faint laughter from
his audience. ‘What can we do for you, oh Disembodied Voice in the Air?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, I just thought I’d check how you’re getting on now that you’ve showed yourself
for the two-timing swindler that you are. Just last week you came to me, all
smarmy and stuff, promising half of your oil for some protection. I told you
where you can put your oil, and guess who you’re playing up to now?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, yes,’ Mr Slick replied, ‘I did go to you. But you never realised why.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You made it perfectly clear.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I wanted to find out something that’s on everybody’s mind. We still don’t know
if you have ever captured any Washers at all. So let me ask you that, Milo Frier,
right here, right now, and I think we all expect an honest answer and some proof.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Milo suddenly became all apologetic. ‘But there simply aren’t any left!’ he whined.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Perhaps you should look in a mirror,’ Mr Slick retorted. ‘Which could be considerably
easier if you’d got at least one arm.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Laughter rippled through the crowd.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I mean,’ Milo continued without any haste, ‘there aren’t any—except you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why don’t you get us, then?’ Mr Slick shouted, stomping his feet. ‘Why don’t
you get us? See how far you get without my oil and the export revenue!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Instead of a reply, there was a faint buzz in the air as a swarm of agents appeared
around the headquarters of the Service. Like a black cloud, they were silhouetted
against the sky lit by the rising sun. They formed ranks that organised into
a floating cube. Its sheer size was enough to blot out the Eastern horizon and
half of the sky as it moved fast across the river toward Mr Slick and the robots.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ina
  jumped on the stage, and tore the microphone out of Mr Slick’s hand.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Friends! Fellow Friers!’ she shouted. ‘We’re caught in a crossfire between these
two aristocrats. It’s not up to us to decide who’s right and who’s wrong now—Exe
sees all and judges all. But it is up to us to defend Exe’s will and ourselves.
I say let’s get Milo and his agents first, and then we’ll see who’s next!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The crowd responded with a rallying cry.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick grabbed Ricco, jumped off the stage with considerable agility, and ran
to one of his vans waiting at the corner. The two women ran after them. Adda
still heard Ina’s voice.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Bring everyone you can! Bring pipes, magnets, welding torches and nets! We won’t
be trodden on! We will win! In Exe’s name!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Feina dragged Adda into the van. The noise of the motor drowned the thunderous
cries of the robots as they sped toward the suburbs.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Mr 
 Slick
  took them to one of his houses, and ordered them to stay in the inner rooms.
The sun was already high up in the sky, and a report was in full swing on the
newscloud. The little particles in the receiver were flitting at an astonishing
speed to keep up with the hasty, shaking reports from the front line.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ina
  hardly waited for the robots to fetch their homemade weapons before ordering
them to march against the Service. Almost everyone in the city joined her; an
incredible crowd billowed in the direction of Power Bridge. Many robots were
slain on both sides during the protracted fights between Ina’s troops and the
agents. The agents attacked in small groups from above, and electrocuted everyone
with their sparkers in their reach. Ina’s plan was to use oversized nets to fight
the agents, and to everyone’s surprise, it worked like a charm. Twenty to thirty
flying robots got trapped in the nets at a time, entangling themselves completely
in the thin wires as they struggled to get free.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Despite the casualties, the rioters won by numbers. About three-quarters of them
made it to the headquarters, and it only took twelve minutes for them to hack
into the building. They got to the roof, and unceremoniously ripped Milo’s head
off the pipes that supported it. The sheer physical force and the damage it caused
killed the Head immediately; it was tossed to the ground, and paraded on the
streets of the capital for hours, where it was followed by a procession. The
warm sun glinted on the bodies of the cheering robots, the dancers, clowns, fire-eaters,
and Mr Slick himself.</p>



<a name="b3c9"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book3.gif" class="img3"/></p><h1>Chapter 9</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">It only took a couple of hours for the inevitable darkness to fall on the kingdom
again. This could’ve made the 
 Friers
  realise that Milo had nothing to do with the darknesses after all, and then
they would’ve either turned on Mr Slick, Ricco, Adda and Feina, or sunk into
apathy and accepted the periodic occurrence of darknesses as a fact of life.
All this could’ve happened, had it not been for a lonesome star on the other
side of the Great Void, which had run out of fuel, and exploded in a supernova
about a million years before. As luck would have it, the star was located just
about a million light-years away from the robots’ planet, and the light of the
explosion, travelling for a million years unimpeded by the nothingness, reached
them in the middle of the darkness.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The dazzling spot on the sky, which even Mr 
 Godnor
  couldn’t explain, was soon named the Ray of Hope.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It shows,’ Mr 
 Slick
  ventured an explanation, ‘Exe’s infinite mercifulness in giving us a new ray
of light during the darkest of hours.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ina agreed. ‘We are on the right track,’ she said, ‘but the road to absolution
will be long and difficult. But soon, if we keep up Exe’s work, more and more
of these bright spots will appear, until they fuse together and make the sky
brighter than ever before. We should all thank Mr Slick for pointing us in the
right direction, and singling out Milo as the traitor among us.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Her words answered a deep yearning for stability after the months of turmoil.
‘Mr Slick for King!’ demanded the headlines, and the speakers at parish halls.
But Mr Slick kindly declined.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I already have enough work to do,’ he said. ‘If there’s anyone who’s worthy
of becoming King, it’s Ricco. He’s proved himself during his long, dangerous
and often uncertain battle with Luxophobe and the Washers.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ina agreed, and the people agreed, and Ricco was crowned King in a week.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Soon after, Ina was indicted of high treason; was found to be possessed by Mumha’s
daemon, and was executed in the same manner as Lavrentiy Checka. It all went
fine; the oil ignited on her forehead, but however hard they tried, they couldn’t
get her heart to burn as well.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Her death was just in time before the supernova disappeared from the sky, because
the darknesses—as predicted by Mr Godnor—continued with clockwork regularity.
Without anyone else to listen to, the robots accepted the official explanation
issued by the Crown. Apparently, they had all committed unspeakable crimes even
before they’d been built, and Exe would turn away from them unless they prayed
six times during each darkness instead of the usual five. Ricco himself spent
most of his time in his private chamber asking Exe to deliver them from Luxophobe.</p>

<p class="pnorm">In a private ceremony, 
 Adda
  was married to Mr Slick, and was asked to be the nanny of Ricco’s new son, which
she accepted. The Prince was the tiniest robot ever built on the planet, and
was shipped with a crib mounted on a golden microscope.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The post of the Head of the Royal Secret Service never got filled again. Mr Slick
was appointed Chief Chancellor, and he, Adda and Feina moved into the residence
on the Filehall. It was necessary to create this new position because Ricco had
gotten into the habit of nominating more and more Chancellors to reward the robots
loyal to him. Although the position had lost some of its prestige by the time
practically everyone in the country became a Chancellor, this turned out to be
a good way of ensuring that no one would revolt against the leaders of the kingdom—never
again.</p>



<a name="b4c1"></a><img src="book4.gif" class="img4"/><br/><h1>Book 4<br/>Chapter 1</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Unknown to it, the tiny speck of metal that was wafted by a stubborn wind towards
the darkness through the Transition Zone reflected a photon off its surface,
and sent it darting towards the Washers like a rifle bullet passing air molecules
the size of gods. Shortly after, the photon hit a semiconductor and dislodged
an electron, which indolently rolled down a copper slide, and flicked a switch
that set off an alarm in the central offices of the Washer Border Agency.</p>

<p class="pnorm">As if all this hadn’t happened, the hot air continued to rise on the light side
of the planet, and moved in the stratosphere to take the place of the descending
cooling gases above the dark hemisphere. The slow but constant wind generated
by this cosmic circulation kept the speck of metal in motion. It was a tiny robot,
a marvel of engineering, and it used to belong to King Ricco. It was his son.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">It was some time before the arrival of the child that 
 Mrs Beetemle,
  following the sudden onset of periods of light and his husband’s untimely death,
was faced both with the task of assuring the citizens of the new country that
despite the sunshine, everything was under control; and with the necessity of
providing an adequate dénouement to the drama and mystery around Councillor
Aved Hhan’s decease. This latter problem wasn’t too hard to tackle, as the murder
story was already past its sell-by date. Mrs 
 Beetemle
  sent for Jot 
 Nifli,
  and, sitting smugly in her 
 underdecorated
office in the Council Hall
behind a heavy steel desk that looked more like a furnace than a piece of furniture,
  proceeded with the first step of her plan, which was to make both Nifli and
the remains of Aved headmasters of the Academy.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t want to do it,’ was Nifli’s surprisingly blunt answer.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Beetemle could hardly contain her surprise.</p>

<p class="pnorm">At length, she said softly, ‘Jot, I need you. Everyone else is dead.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nifli looked directly into her eyes. A certain aloofness and hurt feelings were
evident in his voice.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t think it would be right for me to accept such a post so soon after the
events during the trial.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What events?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nifli ignored her question. ‘And how am I supposed to share my responsibilities
with a pair of legs?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Councillor Hhan,’ Mrs Beetemle retorted, ‘I believe they are called.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Also, I don’t understand this business about Aved’s death being <i>meant</i>
to happen. Why do you keep saying that? Did someone mean it? And who? Oh, but
we aren’t going to answer that question after all, are we?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Alright,’ Mrs Beetemle snapped, ‘tell me what you want.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I want an apology.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’re the headmaster of the Academy. Think of that as an apology, and get stuffed.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Both of them knew that Jot had no real choice in the matter, and he accepted
the position just in time for it to be announced at 
 the state funeral held for Mikke Beetemle and Aved’s upper body.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It is my faith and conviction’, Mrs 
 Beetemle
  creaked through thousands of radio receivers across the country as she stood
behind a microphone at 
 the wrought iron entrance of the junkyard surrounded by Nida, Cynd, the Legs,
dignitaries, and everyone else who had played a part in Aved’s untimely end,
  ‘that Councillor Aved Hhan’s loss was not a random event, and that it was not
a mere result of malice either. And I am not alone. You ask me why I believe
so. I say look at what lies in front of us: a piece of metal, an upper body,
whose software now runs in upper realms. And look at what stands next to us:
a pair of legs, full of power and vigour, signifying the Councillor’s continued
existence in themselves. For can we talk of death, when there is existence? Can
we talk of murder, when there is no death? And can we talk of those responsible
for the non-death of the non-victim? We can’t, and in believing so, I am not
alone.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Aved Hhan has not died. He is now greater than any of us. His head is in the
skies, sharing the Infinite Memory with Ingwyne, Freydy, and their true follower,
Mumha, who impart mercy and grace. His legs are on the ground, and form a chalice
that collects what the head receives, and distributes it among those in need.
His body spans realms, and constitutes the living link between us of mere metal,
and those of pure information.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Surely our race has not received such a divine gift by mere accident. It was
always meant to happen this way. We now see in all its glory Aved Hhan’s greatness,
which allowed him to be chosen to become the messenger of gods. Let us acknowledge
it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We acknowledge it,’ echoed the others around her.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And those who had the privilege to be there at this mystical transformation
were in like manner 
 chosen. Dul Hhan, Jot Nifli, Nida and Cynd Washer—you
  have been chosen. Let us acknowledge it.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We acknowledge it,’ repeated the group.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It is only fitting,’ continued Mrs Beetemle, ‘for me to ask Councillor Aved
Hhan to allow us to honour his Legs with the Silver Cross of Councillors he used
to wear.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">On cue, the 
 Legs
  stepped forward. The cross was then solemnly removed from the remnants of Aved’s
chest, and riveted onto his waist. Once this was done, Mrs Beetemle asked Jot
Nifli to step forward and join the Legs.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘There is one more thing to do before we say our last, sad and hopeful farewells
to the one and a half of you: to you, Mikke Beetemle, a hero and exemplary statesman,
who never failed to serve our country and never succumbed to force, and to the
redeemed part of Councillor Aved Hhan. And that is to reinstate the Legs to their
rightful position of the headmaster of the Academy, and ask Jot Nifli to join
them&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Suddenly, she and the thousands of receivers fell silent. Everybody in the country
knew why: the sky, that had been lightening for an hour, suddenly burst out in
blinding sunrays. Most of the Washers automatically turned towards the sun. Although
it increased their chances of being blinded almost a hundredfold even if they
had the latest V3Ls, it was considered cowardly to turn one’s back to the ethereal
enemy.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Jot
  panicked. The period of light could not have come at a worse time, in the exact
middle of the announcement that would’ve rehabilitated him and placed him above
suspicion of Aved’s murder. In two big strides he was next to Mrs Beetemle, and,
tilting his head to protect his eyes, grabbed the microphone.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hi,’ he started. He paused for a second, and then started to speak quickly,
in a well-rehearsed manner. ‘I am Jot Nifli, and I would like to express my gratitude
to be able to serve our country as the deputy headmaster of the Academy—let
me repeat, the deputy headmaster of the Academy, helping none other than Councillor
Aved Hhan in his duties. I accept this honour with a sense of great responsibility,
as I am well aware the role the Academy has to play in providing security in
these troubled times.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I am certain that standing together, we can overcome any difficulty; that together,
we can face any danger; and that if we unite, Ingwyne’s power will strengthen
us and Mumha’s wisdom will guide our steps. For they are with us, in miracles
big and small, in Aved Hhan’s return, and in the tiniest stroke of luck. Those
of you at home in front of the receivers, who cannot experience the awe-inspiring
presence of the Legs, look around, and you will see how our gods show us our
way in a speck of metal, even in a lone molecule.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The applause that greeted his words across the country was in no small part due
to the planet, which happened to turn away from the sun at so fortunate a speed
that the end of Jot’s speech was uttered in complete darkness again.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">And this was taken as a sign that what Jot Nifli said was all true. A change
was imminent; and it would be heralded by a tiny sign with which Ingwyne and
Mumha would show the Washers the true way to peace and everlasting security.
Everyone was hopeful, and students at the Academy could welcome Aved back—and
mean it, as the Legs were unlikely to write new speeches anytime soon.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But this improvement proved to be temporary. Public unrest grew as the periods
of light continued, and during one of them, the Legs clicked their heels. This
was then widely interpreted to mean that Ingwyne and Freydy had fallen out with
each other; that the Weekrökr and some celestial plate throwing were nigh,
and that the robots were to suffer the consequences.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The Washers
  did everything they could think of to delay the arrival of the end of the world.
Thousands of letters with warm words of encouragement were sent to both Ingwyne
and Freydy urging them to put their domestic differences aside, and Mrs 
 Gridhur,
  who had since retired from the police force, organised rallies where the robots
expressed their sympathy to their gods, and protested against the light and the
rise of Sinmara. Naturally, it fell to the government to respond to the letters,
which they did dutifully. Not because they thought that Ingwyne and Freydy wouldn’t
reply themselves, but they were sure the last thing their gods wanted to do was
to spend all their time typing thank-you notes when they were supposed to get
their relationship back on track and save the world. Soon, however, the amount
of letters became so overwhelming that the government resorted to response slips.</p>

<p class="pnorm">And it didn’t help that the conviction that it showed piety if one bravely faced
Sinmara and the sunlight as opposed to turning away continued to spread. It was
spearheaded by Mrs Gridhur, and caused no little expense to the government to
keep replacing the damaged eyes. At last Mrs 
 Beetemle
  realised that something needed to be done. She decided that the Washers should
join the battle against Sinmara on more practical grounds. In a well-publicised
move, she established the Border Agency, and asked Jot Nifli and the Legs to
continue the research into rice-base weaponry based on Aved’s almost forgotten
work, and to plan and install a system that can detect a light-attack as early
as possible. They were given limited material resources, but could enlist the
best engineers of the country, including Nida, who started to work on the detection
system under Jot’s supervision. Moreover, based on a hunch, Mrs Beetemle also
asked the same team to use astronomy and maths to try to predict when the next
period of light would start. Fearful that a positive result might make Sinmara
and Ingwyne seem more like some clockwork than participants in a desperate universal
war, and might lessen the devoutness of the Washers, she had the operation kept
top secret, but Jot and the Legs weren’t too successful in their forecasts anyway.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The 
 first alert came months later,
  when the detectors of the Border Agency were already in beta, and the senior
class at the Academy were halfway through their last term. The class included
the one-time friends, 
 Cynd, Braxon, and Dul.
  Cynd and Braxon hadn’t rekindled their relationship, and, understandably, Cynd’s
friendship with Dul was also strained. But somehow, through the scarce words
they exchanged, they’d remained close. They knew no one else would understand
what they’d been through, and that they would only have each other to rely on
when they finally started their preparation for war.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Otherwise, students at the Academy were relatively happy. The rhetorical output
of Aved, having lost his head, had decreased significantly, and with Jot Nifli
in charge, they focused more and more on what felt like real studies. 
 Mrs Beetemle’s projects
  were getting on as planned, and, in general, things appeared to have settled
down a little. Until, that is, that fateful moment the photon hit the semiconductor,
and the alarm set off in the offices of the Border Agency before the paint had
had a chance to dry on its walls.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Look out of the window,’ Mrs 
 Beetemle
  said very slowly to 
 Jot Nifli
 and 
Nida Washer, who, as they did so, tried to pretend they weren’t actually 
 in the Councillor’s office.
  ‘What do you see?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was a pause.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s dark,’ ventured Nida. 
 She was slightly larger now, and the new resonators in her thick neck deepened
her voice, but her warm brown eyes had remained the same.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Exactly,’ thundered Mrs Beetemle. ‘You predicted that the light would be here
in an hour. Where is it?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida looked at Jot. ‘We detected a photon about an hour ago,’ she went on to
explain, ‘And so far the statistics showed that the full onset of light followed
the first photon in about an hour.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You wanted the earliest prediction possible,’ Jot added.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I want reliable predictions!’ Mrs Beetemle burst out. ‘There’s no point in throwing
false positives at the government and the society, is there? It’s been quite
an embarrassment already, and I don’t want my credibility undermined any more.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’ll do everything we can,’ said Nida, looking at her feet on 
 the non-slip steel flooring.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You have a week before I pull the plug on this project.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">In a mere couple of minutes, the baby Prince landed neatly just two feet off
the geometric centre of the Forum.</p>



<a name="b4c2"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book4.gif" class="img4"/></p><h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">‘What do you mean it’s missing?’ bellowed 
 Ricco
  as a wisp of smoke appeared around his neck.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s missing. It’s gone,’ explained 
 Adda in the presence chamber,
  trying to whisper while gasping for air. ‘All I did was open a window in the
nursery, and the next thing I knew, a puff of wind lifted it up and carried it
away.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco stood helplessly in front of his throne. 
 In the background, the once rich colours of emeralds and sapphires in the ashlar
wall were now completely washed out by the merciless sunlight that darted through
the air.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Suddenly, a thought crossed his mind. He looked around, and lowered his voice,
but it was almost too strained to be understandable.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why wasn’t it chained to the crib as usual?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You can’t keep a baby in chains all the time.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, it wasn’t like that,’
 Ricco ran his trembling fingers 
through the stiffened coils of his once springy hair that constantly threatened
to dislodge his crown,
  ‘it was for safety! To protect it!’ He paused, trying to think. ‘Why didn’t
you try to get it back?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I ran five miles, but it was too high up in the sky. I could hardly see it in
front of the sun, and then I lost it when it crossed the river.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Did anyone see you?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Probably.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s all your fault, Adda; it’s all your fault, you understand?’ He turned toward
the window. ‘What am I going to tell everyone? What am I supposed to do?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t we have radars and balloons?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco looked at her as if she’d just blasphemed the Light.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Or,’ Adda ventured, ‘perhaps it’d be best if we simply replaced&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Get me Slick,’ Ricco interrupted. ‘Quick! Get moving! And don’t tell anyone
a fucking word!’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Shaking and cold, 
 Adda
  left the Royal Palace, and crossed the road to the 
 new headquarters of Monopoil. Mr Slick
  had been spending more and more time there in an endless series of board meetings
after the production rates of his oil wells had started to fall. This spelt trouble
not only for Monopoil but also for the Crown, as the dwindling sales meant less
revenue, which Ricco had to make up for by raising more taxes. The King’s approval
rating plummeted faster than the production rates, but, actually, the taxes were
only partly responsible for that. As the planet was propelled forward on its
orbit by the gravitational pull of its sun, the darknesses had become longer
and longer despite the fervent prayers of the Friers. And this, in turn, created
the general impression in the kingdom that Exe was losing the fight. Mr 
 Godnor
  had attempted to explain to the robots that this was a natural process, and
there was nothing they needed to do, but the Crown—on Mr Slick’s advice—was
quick to condemn his tenets. And for good reasons, too. Ricco believed religion
gave him power over the Friers, and Mr Slick knew religion gave him power over
Ricco. Still, it didn’t help that what the robots understood of Mr Godnor’s explanation
was that there was nothing they could possibly do.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda knew of the problems of Monopoil, and she didn’t really feel like dragging
Mr Slick out of a meeting where the directors were hunched over sheets of numbers,
took care to avoid each other’s eyes, and discussed something not even the PAs
or Exe was allowed to hear.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It took about fifteen minutes for Slick to emerge from behind the 
 closed steel doors.
  He didn’t say a word, but motioned Adda to follow him through 
 a corridor of darkened glass
 into an empty meeting room.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What’s happened?’ he asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The baby is lost,’ said Adda, and looked up. ‘I lost the Prince.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick didn’t panic. ‘Tell me everything.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda related what had happened; that she’d told Ricco, and what Ricco had said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘He’ll blame me,’ she said, ‘that’s obvious. Could you… could you persuade
him to have it replaced? We could order a new one, and no one would notice. Nobody’s
been let near it anyway.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick smiled, and said, ‘Yes, that is indeed the most sensible strategy.’
He kissed Adda on the cheek, and turned to leave.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are you going to try to talk to him?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes. But I’m going to tell him the exact opposite.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">When Mr Slick looked back from the door, he was already grinning.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘A tragedy!’ he exclaimed. ‘Just what I’ve been waiting for!’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">‘And that,’ Mr 
 Slick
  announced in the 
 presence chamber,
  ordering his pointer particles back into their black Bakelite case, and standing
triumphantly in front of a flip chart with a rough sketch of the planet drawn
on it, ‘concludes my presentation.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m still not sure,’ drawled 
 Ricco
 as he hugged his legs and curled up on the throne.
 ‘Are you sure they kidnapped it? But how?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, you have no idea what Luxophobe and Mumha are capable of. If they want something,
there’s no stopping them.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I thought they couldn’t stand the Light. Isn’t that how Exe keeps them away,
and why we put lamps everywhere?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yeah,’ Mr Slick said, stroking his chin, ‘they can’t stand the Light. When there
<i>is</i> Light.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco leapt to his feet. ‘Oh, I’ve been so stupid! You’re right! The darknesses!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick was slightly amused by the effect of his words. ‘Yes,’ he added, following
Ricco with his eyes, who was now pacing up and down. ‘Yes, indeed.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘If the Washers can get this close during the darknesses, what else can they
do? Or, rather, what else have they already done?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We can only guess,’ Mr Slick said, trying to look concerned.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So what did you say we were going to do?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We attack them.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, yes,’ Ricco said. ‘Yes. That. Right.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Unaware of this development, the 
 Washers
  were all of a doodah thinking that the minuscule chirping metal that had fallen
out of the sky was the tiny Sign of hope predicted by Jot Nifli. It was clearly
a robot, but, unlike them, extremely small; and they also discovered a microscopic
platinum plate under its armpit proudly stating that its bearer had been made
in the Andromeda, which was so far away it could only mean that it was the son
of Ingwyne and Freydy. It must’ve been sent to save their software, they thought;
and although the Washers couldn’t really imagine how it would do that as all
it did was chirping <i>ai, ai,</i> they knew they would need to keep it out
of harm’s way. </p>

<p class="pnorm">They found that it was almost impossible even to pick it up with their oversized,
clumsy fingers, so they wrapped it generously in bubble wrap and put it under
a heavy glass bell until the ceremony Mrs 
 Beetemle
  organised to mark its arrival.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are you sure this thing is from the gods?’ 
 Braxon
 asked his 
mother,
  as the Chancellor and her son drove to the 
 Forum.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Of course I’m not sure,’ she replied. ‘But everyone wants it to be, and for
all I care, it might as well.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd
 and 
Braxon
  were given the honour of carrying the glass bell from the carriage in which
the baby arrived to the platform specially erected in front of the 
 Council Hall.
  Everyone was joyful except the baby, who still couldn’t see much in the dark;
but now at least it could move its arms and legs, as it was gently placed on
a black velvet pillow instead of in a coil of plastic. It kept chirping <i>ai,
ai</i> in a hardly audible, high-pitched voice, and whenever it felt that someone
was nearby, moved its tiny arm, as thin as thread, to point toward where it had
come from.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It did this again when 
 Cynd
  stooped to carefully remove the glass bell. His face was only inches away from
the baby, who became visibly agitated. It was trying to sit up, but kept losing
its balance on the slippery velvet; it was shaking its fist in the usual direction,
and was shouting at the top of its voice—but was still completely inaudible
over the thunderous applause and cheering with which the crowd welcomed him.
It was after Mrs Beetemle had cleared her throat and raised her arm to silence
the robots, and the noise had died away that Cynd finally understood what the
baby was trying to say. It had been shouting ‘Light! Light!’ all along.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">‘What do you think it means?’ 
 Cynd
 asked 
Nida
  back at 
home,
 after he’d told her what he’d heard.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Did it look frightened?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t know. It seemed excited, and I don’t think it was happy.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So it keeps pointing toward the other country, and it says “light”?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Wait a minute. That’s where it comes from, isn’t it?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The baby?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No, the light.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why, yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It might be afraid of the light,’ Nida said, pacing the floor. ‘If he’s the
son of Ingwyne and Freydy, they might’ve sent him not to save us, but…’
Her voice trailed off.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘But because they wanted to save him. They’re losing the war.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd looked at his mother in disbelief.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You don’t really believe in any&nbsp;–’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘This is just speculation,’ Nida interrupted. ‘The real problem is not who the
gods really are, or whether they are in trouble. The real problem is that it’s
only a question of time before someone else realises what the baby is saying.
And then everyone will think that the gods are in danger. And the robots will
want to help them. They’ll want to join the war.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">She paused.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I hope Mrs Beetemle’s got better judgement. Who knows,’ she mused, ‘maybe it
would’ve been better if we’d shot the little fucker down before it got here,
as we always intended to do. But then again, maybe the gods, whomever they are,
<i>are</i> in danger. And maybe he’s really their son.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Three weeks later,
  the first-ever class graduated from the 
 Academy.
  Cynd, Dul and Braxon
  attended a brief ceremony with an uninspiring speech by Jot Nifli. Despite the
best efforts of Nifli, they hadn’t trained much and hadn’t learnt much, as no
one in the new country had much experience in running an academy, let alone a
quasi-military one. A consequence of this was that no one knew what to do with
the graduates either.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They’ll work on civil engineering projects,’ 
 Jot would say while this question was debated in Mrs Beetemle’s office between
the Councillors, Nida, and himself.
  ‘We need proper roads across the mountains, a new Forum for the capital, and
the Academy also needs some updating.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Nonsense,’ objected Mrs 
 Beetemle.
  ‘They’ll help with policing the civilians, and we’ll put some in orbit around
the planet to help Ingwyne and Freydy. We can use the chosen ones.’ She looked
at Nida, and quickly added, ‘Don’t worry, Nida, we’ll bring them back.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The 
 Legs
  were stomping their feet that echoed like broken pots clanging, but no one really
cared.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t think,’ 
 Nida
  ventured, very carefully, but with a quiver in her voice, ‘we’ve got the equipment
to launch anyone into space.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No? Never mind,’ said Mrs Beetemle, ‘we’ll find a way for them to fight the
light anyway.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Perhaps they could help to protect our borders.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Jot sided with Nida. ‘Everyone would feel safer, I think, and it would allow
them to gradually build on their training.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He knew very well how little the Academy had done to prepare the graduates, and
was the one who added, as Mrs Beetemle seemed unimpressed, ‘And we’ve got some
old V18 eyes that were built for light, haven’t we, Nida?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, we’ve just finished refurbishing the first six pairs.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Beetemle regarded them with contemplative eyes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘All right,’ she said at length. ‘Do it.’</p>



<a name="b4c3"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book4.gif" class="img4"/></p><h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Following Nida’s intervention, 
 Cynd
  was deployed to the 
 border of the new country
  closest to the light. Paired up with 
 Dul,
  he’d spend twenty hours at a time on patrol, covering an area that stretched
almost a hundred miles. They had both grown considerably to meet the graduation
criteria. 
 With their reinforced legs, they resembled walking pyramids, and the square shape
of their heads was all the more accentuated by their cubic helmets.
  They were kitted out with a portable hive of military-grade messengers, a spare
battery each; and a magnet to zap and some water to throw at anything that might
cross their path.</p>

<p class="pnorm">They were wading through a layer of thick cyan dust that covered the ground like
the frozen waves of interstellar gases trapped by the stubborn gravitational
pull of labouring galaxies. The horizon, ablaze with light, was lost as the rising
dust blended into the emerald atmosphere. At times it felt as if their feet didn’t
actually touch the ground, but was only kept afloat by the sheer density of this
swamp of fine sand. As far as Cynd could remember, the Transition Zone was now
very different to the grey sea of rock they had originally crossed to settle
in the new country.
  No doubt the planet was changing, and it was changing fast.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Ricco
 very kindly thanked Mr Slick
  for his informative presentation on how the Washers kidnapped the Prince, and
asked him to leave him alone in the 
 presence chamber
  so that he could contemplate the best course of action. At first, Mr Slick seemed
unwilling to do so, but Ricco feigned tiredness, and the Chief Chancellor had
to give up.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco
   kept pacing the sulphur-coloured carpet for hours on end.
 If the Washers were so powerful, was
it really wise to attack them? If their shadowy hands reached as far as the Royal
Palace during the hours of darknesses, what would fighting them on the other
side of the planet achieve? And what was actually on the other side of the planet?
What if the whole army got lost there? They could fall into the bottomless pit
of Hell, or be sucked into a black hole without leaving a single trace of light
behind.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Maybe—Ricco thought—, maybe there was something else to try. Although there
would be no victorious processions and no glorious welcome for the returning
commander-in-chief, but if his plan succeeded, the Washers would realise there
was no point in messing with the smarter guy. He made a visit to 
 the headquarters of the Service
  as inconspicuously as possible, and requested to see the latest batch of graduates
from the police force. He hadn’t been there since his coronation, and the effect
was just as he remembered. The enormous hall he entered was flooded with the
deafening noise of the underground forge of the Service. The shells of police
officers, still built in their original size, dwarfed both the silver agents
and the King. They stood menacingly in an impenetrable line for the royal inspection.
Ricco smiled. Hours later, a score of them were secretly shipped to the edge
of the old country in a covert operation with the sole task of retrieving the
baby Prince.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Cynd
 and 
Dul
  got contacted in the third hour of their 
 patrol.
  They were almost blinded by the tiny arch-lights of the policemen that attacked
them, and the sun, which had just started to rise, didn’t help either.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Three left! Three left!’ Cynd shouted when he noticed three spots of light closing
in on Dul under the cloud of dust around their feet. Although the enemy fighters
seemed quite small, he had learned during basic training that you cannot attack
anything behind a fellow soldier with a magnet or water, so it was up to Dul
to turn as fast as he could move his body, and spray some water in the direction
of the lights.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The lights went out in an instant.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Great,’ Dul hissed. ‘Now where the fuck are they?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Their eyes gave worse and worse images in the increasing light. Even though the
refurbished V18s were supposed to work just fine, the engineers had probably
messed them up when they tried to make them suitable for darkness as well. Cynd
could hear tiny, muffled steps and whispering around them, but he couldn’t see
anything except a haze of burnt out, overflowing pixels as he turned around in
search of the attackers.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I can’t see them,’ he said. After a second, he added, ‘I’ll report to the base.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘OK. I think the water scared them away.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd was about to fish out a messenger from the hive when he felt the excruciating
pain of a white-hot metal needle penetrating the joint in his left ankle.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They’re here! Right at my left!’ he cried.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Dul turned and jumped there. He positioned himself at a right angle to Cynd,
and fired the magnet. It zapped a Frier policeman, and pinned him on the flat
edge of the device. Dul had to stand astride to balance the additional weight.
Although the policeman was hardly larger than Dul’s forearm, he was surprisingly
heavy. He was still holding onto the hot spear, and his joints slowly creaked
as his limbs were twisted and flattened against the merciless electromagnet.
He seemed to be in pain, but he didn’t seem to be afraid.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He looked around quickly, and shouted, ‘There are two of them, guys! Two legs
each! I repeat, two legs each!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Fuck the bastard,’ Dul muttered. Obviously, the thick dust had offered them
some camouflage that he’d now blown by zapping the robot and letting it see them
from above.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He wanted to silence the Frier, and gave more juice to the magnet. The currents
induced in the policeman’s brain seemed to have done him in. Dul let him drop
to the ground. It arrived with a muffled clatter and was greeted with some excited
shouting.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd heard this all too well. ‘Brace, brace to me!’ he gave the command. He still
couldn’t move his foot, and needed Dul to get to him. Dul started to manoeuvre
himself to stand back to back to Cynd so that they could attach to each other
with the special hooks welded onto their backs. This formation gave Washer soldiers
more stability, as a pair stood on four legs, and preliminary tests had shown
that they could withstand considerable physical shocks.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But the Friers were quicker. As Dul lifted one of his feet to step closer to
Cynd, he lost his balance, and, with a thundering noise, disappeared under a
cloud of pebbles, sand and dust.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are you okay?’ Cynd cried.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oil!’ Dul answered, from below. ‘The fuckers poured oil everywhere! Don’t come
here!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd didn’t expect to be able to see anything in the flying debris, but the cloud
of dust partially obscured the sunlight. He could only just discern Dul lying
on the ground, with white points of light running about him. One light climbed
on his head, and balanced in the middle of his forehead.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd could see the blue arc of the sparker reflected by Dul’s eye socket. Dul’s
shriek resounded across the plain, which was already bathing in full daylight.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Fortunately, however, 
 Cynd and Dul
  didn’t sustain more serious injuries, and the 
 Friers
  disappeared as suddenly as they came. As 
 Cynd
 helped 
Dul
  to get up, they discovered six small policemen crushed into the ground, who’d
left bowl-shaped dents in Dul’s back plate. Cynd finally managed to send a messenger
to report to the base, and although they were covered in oil and dust, and Cynd
could only hobble, they got back well before a rescue team could be dispatched.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The seven casualties the 
 Frier officers
  had suffered made them realise that they had no chance of overcoming the two
giants. The sergeant decided to withdraw, file a report, and call for backup
before attacking again. But either because their messenger lost its way, or because
Ricco couldn’t afford to assign more agents to the operation, the backup never
arrived, and the small troop decided to go home.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Unbeknown to them, Mr Slick had attempted to prevent desertion from the Service
by having the agents’ batteries reduced to half their original capacity so that
they would need to return to the headquarters more often. Although just after
a couple of miles, the agents in the troop abandoned the police-officer shells
to save power, and piled them up nicely so that they could retrieve the expensive
equipment later, they all perished on the way back to the old country, dying
the slowest and most dreaded death known to robotkind.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">The ambush finally drove it home for the Washers that their gods were not the
only ones under attack, and that the attacks were coming from something more
tangible than a bunch of photons. Mrs 
 Beetemle
  upped the R &amp; D on the rice weapons, as months of intense laboratory work and
genetic engineering still failed to make the rice more aggressive. There was
a silver lining, though; a single seedling that exhibited ferrivore tendencies,
but as 
 Nida
  soon discovered, the steel pin in its stem was due to poor anger management
among overworked and frustrated researchers rather than a miraculous capability
of the plant to hunt down and devour small metal objects within its reach.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We need to be prepared,’ Mrs Beetemle kept saying both during the meetings of
the High Council and in public; ‘we need to be prepared for the worst.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Public speeches
  reiterating the same idea became more and more frequent, with Mrs 
 Beetemle
  standing in front of the 
 Council Hall,
  gesticulating heavily while shouting into the microphone. All this would happen
on a stage with a special pulpit for the ever-present glass bell, and screens
all around displaying live video of the baby under it, with the image slightly
scaled down to make it appear even more out of this world, and the caption ‘Light!
Light!’ constantly scrolling at the bottom. 
 Jot Nifli and the Legs
  would stand next to Mrs Beetemle, supporting the effective leader of the new
country. Jot would raise his head and try to avoid looking at the crowd, reminding
himself to look positive and determined every other minute. Maybe there was another
way of resolving this issue, he kept thinking, but was unsure if there was anything
he could do. He’d already marshalled his reasons against planting the idea of
unavoidable war in the heads of the citizens during the last 
 Council meeting.
  He feared for his students, and felt the weight of the overwhelming amount of
research still needed to produce adequate weapons and protection. And, the nagging
thought, that he’d been careful not to mention even to his researchers: who knows
what really went on with Ingwyne, Freydy, and Mumha?</p>

<p class="pnorm">During the 
 last meeting,
  the Legs had begun kicking the 
 table
  as soon as he’d finished speaking.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘See?’ Mrs Beetemle had said. ‘They agree with me.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Jot had started to say something, but checked himself.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m sure you know,’ Mrs Beetemle continued, ‘what the Academy, the Border Agency,
and the research projects have in common.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">He knew. It was that they depended on the continued fight with the light, Sinmara,
and the Friers. And that he led all of them.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">‘Fellow Washers!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd’s
  ankles needed to be repaired, and he was given some time off until they were
ready. So, he was sitting 
 at home
 in the living room with 
Nida
  when, quite unexpectedly, the 
 radio switched to Mrs Beetemle’s voice.
   The thin metal sheet walls of their house only gave the illusion of separation
anyway, and with this intrusion, it felt as if they were sitting on a sofa out
in the open, cold in the darkness, with Mrs Beetemle eyeing them from a black
tower somewhere on the horizon.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Fellow Washers! Months of events of historical significance have passed, and
months of the greatest decisions lie ahead. I speak to you in these serious times.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You all know how two of our bravest soldiers, Cynd Washer and Dul Hhan, the
son of Councillor Hhan, were ambushed while on patrol to protect our homeland.
They were attacked by a cowardly enemy hiding below the ground, setting on them
when their vision was temporarily obscured by a cloud of dust.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The light, more like,’ murmured Cynd. ‘We should’ve been given proper eyes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nida looked at him, but the radio didn’t stop.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thousands of robots attacked them, and it was only thanks to their perseverance,
their courage and heroism, as well as to the excellent training they had received
that they not only survived and killed scores of the attackers, but sustained
superficial injuries only. Mumha and her masters, Ingwyne and Freydy were with
them that time, and may they always be.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Alas, we learned our lesson the hard way, and after this unfortunate event,
we could no longer pretend that the forces of the light only threatened our gods.
We ourselves are under attack. And if Fate has so willed that we will not be
spared this fight, I can only be grateful that it entrusted me with the leadership
in this universal struggle, which will be described by future generations as
decisive not only for our planet, but indeed for the whole galaxy.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd got up; a bit more suddenly than he intended to.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’m too tired for this,’ he said, and went back to his room.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But he didn’t go to standby, and didn’t connect to the outlet. He selected a
messenger from the latest generation in his hive, and composed a short message.
He was careful not to sign it and to word it as casually as he could, and then
to wipe the surface of the messenger clean with a cloth. He peeked out the window,
then opened it wide, leaned out, and hurled the messenger as far away from their
house as he could. It was a message to Adda, and it read: ‘Cable Street, just
around the corner! Lovely to see you all again, hope you’ve brought everything.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">This generation of messengers had rudimentary wings with which they could fly
short distances,
 and so the messenger bot was able to approach the 
 old country
  conveniently hidden by the products of the Friers’ cloud factory. First, it
flew to Cable Street, but quickly realised that Adda wasn’t there. It had a hard
time locating her, but finally found Adda in the 
 Royal Palace.
 She was hurrying 
past the Mega Maze when
  the shadow cast by the messenger made her stop. It landed in front of her feet,
missing her by a mere inch. She jumped back to save her life. Whatever dropped
from the sky was quite obviously a messenger, but it was almost as large as her.</p>

<p class="pnorm">And, of course, it didn’t fail to attract the attention of just about everyone
in the Court.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Another period of darkness was about to start when 
 Adda,
  huffing and puffing having run almost two miles, arrived in front of the 
 residence of the Chancellor
  on the Filehall. She hoped to find her husband there, but it was 
 Feina
  who greeted her in the hall. She’d been living there as the mother-in-law of
the Chief Chancellor ever since the coronation.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I saw that thing,’ she said as she whisked Adda along into a reception room
on the ground floor, and carefully closed the cast iron door.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Oh, yes. Adda had forgotten that her mother was helping out with phrasing the
announcement balloons the Court released, and had gotten into the habit of standing
on the balcony, doing some last-minute proofreading as they passed above the
residence.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It looked like a messenger,’ she looked inquiringly at Adda.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, I guess it was.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Did you read it?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Of course I didn’t. It nearly killed me. And I’m not sure it was for me, at
any rate.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Messengers hardly ever make mistakes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda was getting irritated. ‘Well, it wasn’t exactly a normal messenger, was
it?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes, yes, that’s the main thing!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Feina started pacing the 
 chequered floor
 in a surge of excitement. She, just like Slick, seemed to deliberately ignore
both Adda’s distress and the obvious danger she was in.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Do you think,’ her mother mused, ‘that it was from the other side?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why, was it you who sent it?’ Adda snapped.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, for Exessake, Adda, get a grip! It was quite obviously not a Frier messenger.
How did they know you were there? Why did they want to contact you? We need to
know everything to figure out what to do. Why in Exe’s name didn’t you think
of reading the damn thing?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda remained silent. She had good reasons to resent her mother’s plans to fix
things.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Where’s Slick?’ she finally asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Before her mother could’ve replied, the sound of sirens pierced through the air.
Feina flung open the window that gave onto the driveway, and turned back to face
Adda. The police cars screeched to a stop in front of the entrance.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Stop right there, you aluxic agent of Hell!’ Feina yelled, as loud as she could.
‘Stop, or… I don’t know what I’ll do!’</p>



<a name="b4c4"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book4.gif" class="img4"/></p><h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">Adda,
  suspected of selling the baby Prince to Luxophobe, was jailed pending further
investigation. The photo of her receiving the little tin box was widely circulated
in the newscloud as a favour by Mr 
 Slick’s
  many connections in the media. But just hours later, she was out again (in exchange
for priority growing treatments granted to a judge and two prison guards at the
People’s Smith), and was secretly transported back to Mr Slick’s residence and
put under house arrest. The operation, carried out by a bunch of 
 agents
  from the Service, took place during a darkness so dark that she had no idea
where they were going. But the agents must’ve been a new version, freshly out
of the forge, and, to Adda’s surprise, they could see in the dark just as well
as in broad sunlight.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">‘I understand that you wanted to solve the problem without open confrontation
with the Washers, but it’s messed up everything!’ said Mr 
 Slick,
  hardly being able to contain his frustration, in the 
 presence chamber with Ricco and Feina.</p>

<p class="pnorm"><i>‘Your Majesty,’</i> Ricco corrected him. ‘Start again.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Slick took a deep breath. ‘I understand Your Majesty’s desire to solve our little
problem without open confrontation with the Washers, but it has really put me
in a difficult position.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s better. Talking of positions, <i>we</i> don’t think your Adda’s latest
blockheaded move to let the Prince go left either of us jumping for joy.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t think it was exactly her fault,’ said Feina.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Whose fault was it, then?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was Mr Slick who replied. ‘Did you expect her to defend the Prince single-handedly
against a troop of Washers?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco remained silent.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Feina was looking nervously at Ricco, then at the Chief Chancellor.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I did what you asked me to do, Slick,’ she said, ‘but tell me, do either one
of you really think that Adda has anything to do with Luxophobe?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick looked at her distantly, lost in his own thoughts.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘She’s a victim, for Exessake, a victim of the situation!’ Feina’s voice rose
to a high-pitched, trembling cry. ‘She’s not a bad robot, and… and anything
she’s accused of will reflect badly on you, as well.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We’re under attack,’ Mr Slick attempted to console her, ‘and it’s natural to
feel stressed and confused. Adda is innocent, until proven guilty with absolute
mathematical certainty, and that is not the case.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">A weak smile crossed Feina’s face.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you,’ she said. ‘Will you protect us from Mumha and the rest?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We will. I promise. Now get some rest, Feina. I’ll handle this from this point
on.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Feina bowed and left
  like an ageing giant whose power had all but dwindled to nothing. Ricco buried
his face in his hands.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Maybe we should try again,’ he said finally.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And lose another score of perfectly good agents? I don’t think so.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, as far as I know, you haven’t been crowned yet, and as for me, I want
to explore all avenues before declaring an all-out war.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’re wasting your time. You’re wasting <i>my</i> time. You’re wasting everybody’s
time.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘OK, tell me why you want to attack them so much.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why? Because we’re under attack. Because they have the Prince. Because the Frier
King cannot look like a coward.’</p>

<p class="pnorm"><i>‘We</i> are no coward. Perhaps we are being cunning.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘If you say so,’ Mr Slick said. ‘And then, there’s the oil.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t care about the oil.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You need the revenue, Ricco.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s too dangerous. How would I look, putting faithful subjects in danger’s
way just to get a bit more oil? We’ll find something else to export.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh yes? And what? Clouds or rice?’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Jot Nifli,
  having waited for more than an hour, was finally standing in front of 
 Mrs Beetemle
  in her office, which now 
 boasted a set of brutalist coffee cups made of thick glass beyond the barest
necessities.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Councillor Beetemle,’ he started, ‘who exactly entrusted you with the leadership
in a future war?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Beetemle was sure this was only the first in a well-planned series of questions,
and remained calm. Sitting behind her 
 heavy desk,
  she raised her eyes to meet those of Jot. ‘I’m a Councillor, Nifli. Anything
else?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Indeed, you are <i>a</i> Councillor.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Do you expect the Legs to go lead our troops?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I thought they are the ones supposed to dine with the gods.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, let’s ask them again.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Beetemle summoned the Legs, who promptly began kicking the desk. The deafening
clangs reverberated in the small office.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘See?’ she asked when it was over.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Jot squinted. ‘I don’t think they agree.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Whereas <i>I</i> think they do.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How do we resolve this difference of opinion, Councillor?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh we don’t need to. You see, Mr Nifli, as you’ve just pointed out, I’m a Councillor.
You’re not.’ She paused. ‘Is there anything else?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You can’t get away with this. It’s your pride; it’s that you want to be seen
as a wartime leader that pushes this country into a deadly conflict. But this
is not a dictatorship. You can’t force the robots to follow you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You forget it wasn’t me who attacked our country. It would’ve been better if
it had never happened. And you also forget I’ve never forced anyone to follow
me.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I’ll make sure everyone knows about your egomaniac obsession with fighting photons.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Feel free to try. Personally, I doubt anyone will listen.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I have predicted the Sign. I’m practically the spiritual leader of this country.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Then what are you complaining about? It’s all your fault. This is the natural
consequence of the religion you’ve started.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Jot Nifli lost his temper. ‘I had to say something when you just stopped because
of the darkness! You could’ve seen it coming, and even when it did, you should’ve
dealt with it! You wanted me to accept the position at the Academy so that you
could sit back and forget about the murder once and for all. To be honest, I
begin to think Aved’s and Mikke’s deaths came in pretty handy for you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">It took a second for the echo of his words to die away in the room.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Mr Nifli, I have lately grown quite tired of your bitter opposition to anything
I propose, the only conceivable source of which is your sympathy for the Friers.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nifli took a step back. ‘You wouldn’t dare to.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Beetemle stood up. ‘I have made you; I can just as easily unmake you. It
seems that that old lady in the Memory House was right after all.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">A knock interrupted the silence that followed 
 Mr Slick’s
  rhetorical question in the 
presence chamber,
  and Mr 
Godnor
 was announced. 
 Ricco
  sat back on the throne as Slick gave up centre stage to the newcomer.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Your Majesty,’ Mr Godnor bowed in front of the King. 
 His ears, from which the paint had long worn off, dangled wearily from his skull.
His joints creaked and spurted oil as he bent down with difficulty, and one or
two plates rattled in protest on his torso.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘My dear Mr Godnor,’ Ricco extended his arm, ‘do straighten your back. To what
do we owe the honour of your visit?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘There is something, Your Majesty, that concerns me greatly, and by your leave,
I wish to let you know the subject of my concern.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Speak, dear Mr Godnor; you are like an older brother, nay, a father to us.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Thank you, my liege. It is rumoured that the Crown plans to conquer the darker
side of our planet in retaliation for the Washers taking the baby Prince.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We cannot deny it,’ replied Ricco. ‘You know us: we have always been an enemy
of cowardly and weak decisions.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Godnor bowed his head. ‘We are all thankful that we have such a leader as
you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco smiled.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘An old adage has occurred to me, however,’ Mr Godnor went on, ‘that says one
must not attribute to wrongdoing what could’ve been the work of chance.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What do you mean by that?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The Washers or Luxophobe may have nothing to do with the disappearance of the
Prince, Your Majesty. Some chance wind could’ve very well been capable of carrying
it away.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco remained silent. Mr Godnor plucked up his courage, and continued.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Attacking anyone or anything based on what could’ve been a random event would
be unjust, and could do more harm than good.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco stood up. 
 The stiffened coils of his hair followed each stir of his head as he stepped
forward.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘How dare you come here and take the side of Hell? How dare you insinuate that
our judgement is clouded? Why don’t you suggest that we all join you in worshipping
Luxophobe and surrender?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You misunderstand me. I wouldn’t dream of siding with the Washers, and I abhor
Mumha and Luxophobe as much as you do. That has nothing to do with the fact that
the disappearance of the Prince could’ve been an accident.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You say we misunderstand you. On the contrary. We understand not what you merely
say, but what you actually mean.’ Ricco saw Slick smiling behind Mr Godnor. ‘You’re
here to try to dissuade me from attacking our arch-enemies claiming that whatever
happened wasn’t their fault. But we will never falter. Exe has turned away from
all of us because of sins we committed and our forefathers committed. By joining
His war against the aluxic Washers, in prayer and in arms, we will all be able
to wash away the stain, and be delivered from the Hell of Luxophobe.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Godnor remained silent for a second; then looked up.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They haven’t got any oil, you know.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No one can know if they’ve got any,’ Mr Godnor insisted with his steady glance
drilling into Ricco’s eyes. ‘No one here has been on the other side of the planet,
and no one here is supposed to have been in contact with the Washers. Therefore,
whoever says that he knows they’ve got oil is lying.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘All right,’ Mr Slick intervened, ‘this has been going on for long enough. You
know where you’d be now if you weren’t the “other king” of the dead King.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Godnor turned his head to face Slick.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I don’t. Tell me.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Suddenly, Slick put his arm around Mr Godnor’s shoulder, and steered him towards
the small cells of glass of a window.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s very nice of you to try to protect the Friers. You must love the robots
out there very much.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Godnor remained silent.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Slick continued, ‘But do they love you? Do they understand you? You’re a scientist.
And look at what they believe,’ he nodded toward Ricco. ‘They think their thoughts
have an actual effect on the darknesses and how this planet moves. Their thoughts,
Godnor! Prayers! How heavy you said our planet was? Eighty-six septillion?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Eighty-six point eight.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Exactly. You tried to bring the light to them, and they didn’t listen. You tried
to show them what was really happening, and, instead, they came up with their
own primitive theories. What are them to you?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Godnor waited a couple of seconds before responding. Forming his words carefully,
he said, ‘It’s true that I’ve tried to explain to them the little I know about
the world and the planets, and they didn’t seem to be interested. I’m afraid
I’m rather bad at explaining things. I wish I wasn’t, but I am, and therefore,
many of them chose to believe someone else giving a different explanation for
the darknesses. But one thing I know: you cannot choose to believe someone telling
falsehoods unless there is someone telling them.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mr Slick regarded him in contemplation as Mr Godnor bowed in front of the King,
hastily asked for permission to leave, and closed the door shut after himself.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I didn’t understand a word you said there,’ Ricco said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t worry. We won’t hear from him again.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The rusty fucker comes here and accuses me of incompetence,’ fumed Ricco in
indignation. ‘If we wait much longer, everyone will be infected by the Washers!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It seems so, yes.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We must act now. We’ll hunt down Luxophobe’s agents; we’ll kill the last aluxic
in the kingdom! In Exe’s name!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Amen,’ said Mr Slick.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So, what do we do now?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The war, Your Majesty.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, that. Yes. Right.’</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Mrs Beetemle
  started to prepare a speech exposing Jot Nifli for the Frier spy that he once
again was, but Nifli having died rather unexpectedly during a jousting tournament
he participated in to show his devotion to Ingwyne and the homeland—but during
which, unfortunately, he matched his strength against a graduate as big as a
warship, and lost—, there was no need to finish it. All she needed to do was
to present Nifli’s only surviving part in a way that avoided making the Academy,
which was to be led by a pair of lower extremities and a dishevelled <i>coiffure,</i>
the laughing stock of the galaxy.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Mr Godnor
  was tried, and found to be suspect of heresy, and was ordered to publicly recant.
His telescope was confiscated, as it was argued that it was peering into Exe’s
realm, something no mortal can bear, that affected his mental capabilities and
allowed Luxophobe to use him as a vehicle to spread false tenets about the order
of the world.</p>

<p class="pnorm">In the last volume of his diaries, which were subsequently seized and destroyed,
he wrote, ‘I understand how we live from one wave function collapse to another
in a branching forest of superpositions. I understand how the most insignificant
electron that tunnels through a potential barrier contributes to the existence
of the Sun, or a person. I can predict what will happen with relative certainty,
and could even simulate the whole Universe, or another version of it. But what’s
the use of all this if I’m trapped inside the real world? What use is this knowledge
when there’s a war, and a whole generation marches cheerfully into certain death?
I’d sooner be blind and blissful in my ignorance than see what is about to happen
and be impotent to change a thing.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I understand the zeal of the young, and see that it is their destruction—yet
I cannot go and pick their brains like a lock, one by one, to cure them of it.
I see the machinations of the ones in power, and how it poisons the rest of us—yet
I’m feeble, and I’m not able to get near them in any way. Perhaps the time will
come when we know enough of the world and things like quantum entanglement so
that a physicist, locked up in a laboratory in a tiny nook of a remote galaxy,
can change kings’ minds at her will. Perhaps then the dead will live again, and
my Sayn will once more be more than a navel. But I don’t believe we’ll ever get
there—the age of real wizards, tangible magic, poetic justice and, of course,
true unimaginable evil—, and something tells me it’s for the better. The route
to the future is long, lined with puddles of electrolyte and rusting wrecks,
and, without an undo button, one falls victim to either too little, or too much
foresight.’</p>



<a name="b4c5"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book4.gif" class="img4"/></p><h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">On both hemispheres, the 
 robots
  held rallies, wrote poems, and composed songs to their respective gods, and
queued—chatting happily to pass the time—in front of the kiosks that had
cropped up all around the planet to enlist in their armies. When they had finished
the procedure, and had been found to be suitable, they were given a bouquet of
red and amber light-emitting diodes on the lighter side, and a tiny glass pendant
with a drop of water sealed into it and a ball chain necklace on the darker one.</p>

<p class="pnorm">When 
 Ricco
  finally got round to announcing publicly that the Washers had taken the baby
Prince, no one was surprised. Every Frier knew they would need to fight Luxophobe,
and purloining their heir to the throne seemed a rather trivial misdeed compared
to the crimes he had committed according to the weekly letters circulated and
read during the communal prayers.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But, as soon everyone realised, being a recruit was not all fun and electricity.
Every robot had to satisfy certain requirements before they were considered ready
for action, and the robots were busy reconfiguring themselves to meet them.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Every Washer soldier
  needed to be at least sixteen tons. The People’s Smith (actually, now the People’s
Smiths) had never had so many plates to rivet, tubes to solder, feet to widen,
and heads to reinforce than now that the Washers decided to turn all their metal
into one-inch-thick armours. The Smiths had also grown powerful magnets to zap
the enemy, and began the process of founding hundreds of water cannons.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Meanwhile, jousting tournaments were organised 
 outside the crater of the capital
  to train the soldiers in using these new weapons as they became available. Many
unfortunate fighters had to be rebooted after these events. The magnets bent
and twisted their limbs, often tearing them from their sockets; the water drowned
their circuits, filled up their eyes, and shorted their powerful minds. The water
cannons became the most feared weapons after the Legs had found a way of making
them cause almost instant shutdowns by kicking a bucket of salt into the pool
used to fill them up. Scores of young soldiers, the pride of Washer engineering,
had to be rebuilt from the crushed, charred shells that were left littering the
tournament field.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs 
 Beetemle
  also gave orders to develop brand new eyes that could see in sunlight as well
as in complete darkness, and assigned even more resources to the development
of rice weapons. 
 Nida
  had been overseeing this research for some time, and now it also became her
responsibility to give eyes to a whole army. The work progressed at the heart
rate of a bipolar stepper motor, and she knew they wouldn’t be ready by the time
the invitations appeared in the new country.</p>

<p class="pnorm">And soon enough, they did. Large, calligraphic letters printed on posters made
of exquisite rag paper advertised the upcoming event in both countries: ‘Councillor
Beetemle (on the other side, HM King Ricco) requests the honour of your presence
at the War to be fought against our arch-enemies, Sinmara and the Serpent (or
Luxophobe and Mumha), scheduled to coincide with the twentieth light (darkness)
from this hour.’ The design also included twenty boxes on each poster, made of
thick, sinister lines, that zealous patriots were expected to cross as the time
progressed toward their inevitable doom.</p>

<p class="pnorm">In the last minute, 
 Nida
  put together everything they had. They’d got several batches of improved eyes
that had a better gamma. They’d managed to grow an enormous amount of rice with
which they filled hundreds of projectiles, planning to effectively drown the
enemy in the produce. They also made some headway with an old project of Aved,
the territorial rice. Although they hadn’t been able to reach the reproduction
rate predicted by the late Councillor, the results looked promising, and so they
prepared five balls of seedlings for deployment. Despite the disappointing research,
Mrs 
 Beetemle
  was satisfied with the new weapons. During the trials, the rice grains managed
to bury a whole village in less than fifty seconds; the empty houses and their
corrugated walls were squashed and torn through as they disappeared under the
pitiless torrent of whiteness.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">Neither of the armies knew much about what they were facing, but the 
 Friers,
  with Ricco’s mission lost, had absolutely no idea. Therefore, they prepared
for every eventuality. For starters, all recruits had to shrink themselves to
about a tenth of their original size. Smaller robots were much faster, and reacted
to attacks at lightning speed, finding the perfect formation and launching counter-strikes
in under ten milliseconds. What’s more, the miniature soldiers used a fraction
of the electricity needed to run a normal robot, which was a very useful thing,
considering that there wasn’t much room left in them for their batteries.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The backbone of the army was the division of agents from the Service. Mr 
 Slick
  had decided that there was no longer any need to hide them in the bodies of
police officers. Their target reduction rate was higher than the usual, 0.3,
but, with their wings and long-distance sparkers, that still made them the smallest
and most advanced fighters. The rest of the infantry wasn’t much less dangerous,
either. They were given new eyes; entire battalions were equipped with wings,
and the standard weapon became the newly developed oil jet, the mildest effect
of which was incapacitating a robot by making it unable to stand on its feet
or wheels, but the high-pressure jet could easily loosen all its screws and rivets,
effectively dismantling its machinery in about a minute. Entire squads were reduced
to their brains during military exercises, and Mr Slick and 
 Ricco
  were already quite confident in the capabilities of the new weapon. Still, 
 Lauda
  thought they could do better. She suggested adding an ignition system.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The effects of her newly invented flamethrowers were hard to describe. The whole
fireteam that tested them first had to be demobilised, and the soldiers had to
be treated for the shock they suffered as they helplessly witnessed the horrific
deaths of their comrades at their own hands. (None of them lived to see the start
of the war. They all committed suicide mere hours after they’d been discharged
from hospital.) The effectiveness of the flamethrowers was beyond question. Mr
Slick ordered converting all the oil jets personally.</p>

<p class="pnorm">And the flamethrowers were not the only things the Friers hoped would secure
their victory. The cloud factory had been partly rebuilt to produce war-balloons.
Instead of beryllium, they were made of a special alloy, because it was less
brittle, and generally thought to be more suitable for deployment. Each balloon
carried a remote-controlled machine gun mounted on its surface, which hewed down
all the centuries-old ordered trees in Screen Park during a test when a lieutenant
sent the target coordinates in the wrong order. And then there was the secret
weapon of the robots of fire: the heat ray. The deadly microwaves were generated
by terawatt oscillators mounted on motorised tanks, and fried any electronic
brain in a five-mile radius, and disoriented robots up to fifteen miles away.
Having developed weapons to destroy both the bodies and minds of the enemy, the
Friers felt there was little that could stop them.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">It was during the endless jousting tournaments and military exercises, the displays
and parades that the customary meeting of the envoys of the two countries took
place 
 in the middle of the Transition Zone.
  It was only partly to make a last-ditch effort to avert an open confrontation,
and more to decide who would be covering the expenses. Etiquette dictated that
wars were to be paid for by whoever started them, but in this case it turned
out to be rather difficult to agree on who the aggressor was.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, you started it by kidnapping our Prince,’ blinked 
 Pattero’s eye.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Both countries had sent their wisest and most experienced as their envoys hoping
to secure a good deal. This is what had brought about the birth of the monstrous
assembly of 
 some hair, an eye, a hand, a navel and a pair of legs in the Transition Zone.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What?’ mimed 
 Aved’s
legs.
  It took some time for them to understand what Pattero was saying, but when they
did, they could hardly believe it. 
 Nifli’s hair
  was standing on end. ‘We haven’t kidnapped anyone.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Then where’s the child?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">So it wasn’t from Ingwyne and Freydy after all! </p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Who exactly are we talking about?’ asked the hair cautiously.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Why,’ 
 Kantro’s hand
  joined in, ‘who but the baby Prince, HM King Ricco’s miniature son!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The hair and the legs withdrew for a moment. Pattero looked at them, and then
glanced meaningfully at 
 King Sayn’s navel.
  It was Aved’s lower half that conveyed, speaking very slowly, the Washers’ response.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We acknowledge that there exists in our country a robot that fits your description,
and therefore it probably is what you call the Prince. We also wish to let you
know that our country has played no active role in its displacement, and therefore
we have every reason to believe that its movements have been controlled by you.
This, in turn, makes this robot a threat to our national security, and we have
taken steps to ensure that it is destroyed as is customary with any suspected
spying device.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What!’ exclaimed Pattero in indignation. ‘You’ve stolen the Prince and now you
threaten to kill him?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The Prince, humbug!’ retorted Aved. ‘It’s a spy, and you sent it!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Well, we didn’t send it!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘And we didn’t steal it!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, indeed! Next you’ll say that it’s not you who regularly plunge our kingdom
in darkness!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Good news is, it’s not! It’s you who flood our hemisphere with light, trying
to burn us out!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Gentlemen, gentlemen,’ 
 Sayn
  interrupted. ‘Let’s not lose our heads. We are not here to accuse each other
of misdeeds, but to find out who is ultimately responsible.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That’s easy to settle,’ ventured Kantro, ‘all we need to determine is which
was first, the light or the darkness.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">A couple of minutes’ silence ensued.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘That does not seem to be easy,’ the navel replied. ‘There have always been some
darkness, and there have always been some light.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh, shut up,’ Pattero snapped. ‘You can’t even see! Why don’t you simply offer
them to pay for the whole war?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘So have we agreed that it’s inevitable?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Pattero turned to the Washers. ‘OK. You assure us that the Prince has never entered
your country and you have never seen it or interacted with it, and there’s no
war.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Nifli immediately realised what the impossible condition meant.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No,’ he replied, ‘you assure us that the Prince has never left your country,
and there’s no war.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘War it is, then,’ said Kantro.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Agreed,’ said Aved.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But at that moment, a lightning struck. It broke up the body parts and the conference,
and Mrs Beetemle and King Ricco were forced to start the war without a financial agreement.</p>



<a name="b4c6"></a><p class="imgp"><img src="book4.gif" class="img4"/></p><h1>Chapter 6</h1>

<p class="pbigskip">The swirling dust of the 
 Transition Zone
 turned into a landscape of feverish expectation as the armies, like so many
tin soldiers, lined up facing each other. It was close to impossible to judge
the distance between them among the featureless waves of the fine sand. The Washers
were quite relaxed: they saw that the Friers were quite far away, and that they
were unlikely to start the battle from their position. But they were wrong. The
Friers felt threatened by the proximity of their enemy, and hardly waited for
the speech of the best man to end before 
 Ricco
  decided to launch the attack.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Facing King Ricco, commander-in-chief, was General 
 Beetemle,
  the only surviving whole Councillor. She was advised by 
 Nida,
 who joined Beetemle in watching the developments through binoculars from the
top of their twenty-metre-high, cone-shaped legs.
 In front of them were the Washer
soldiers, heaps of metal neatly organised into divisions and companies, each
led by a chosen Washer. 
 Cynd, Dul and Braxon
  all led a company of 200 infantrymen, and Mrs 
 Gridhur,
  who’d swapped her retirement years for a military career, commanded a whole
division. They were painted black, and richly decorated with silver on the corners
to distinguish them from lower-ranking members of the army.</p>

<p class="pnorm">King Ricco was seated under an improvised canopy of crimson silk interwoven with
gold, strategically placed on a dune so that he could oversee his army and the
progress of the battle.
 His next in command was 
 Feina,
  constantly buzzing around the canopy on her new wings. 
 Lauda
  was selected as the PR manager of the battle. Mr 
 Slick
  was nowhere to be seen. He’d stayed at home in his Filehall residence, but,
to make up for his absence, he’d sent Adda instead to tend to the wounded and
help wherever she could. During her house arrest, 
 Adda
 hadn’t participated in the compulsory reduction, so she was considerably larger
than the rest; and because of the amber light she carried with her to be seen
from a distance, she instantly became known as the lady with the lamp.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The Frier army itself stretched almost a mile from the canopy at the back to
the foremost row, and was more than two miles in width. The neat ranks of the
infantry followed by rows of agents resting their wings on their backs were breaking
up as the soldiers fidgeted about, shooting nervous glances at the enemy that
seemed to be way too close. Their movements were mirrored in the air by a layer
of balloons. Every soldier had one attached to their head with a silver string,
which, apart from keeping the balloon from escaping, also made it possible to
control the machine gun on it with a mere thought.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Finally, the moment came when the best man left the stretch of land between the
armies. 
 Ricco
  wasted no time in signalling to charge. The sirens sounded, and the first lines
of Frier infantry began running towards the Washers.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘In Exe’s name!’ they shouted, and the captains encouraged them with cries of
‘Death to Luxophobe! Death to Mumha!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘They’re coming,’ 
 Nida
 noted to Mrs 
Beetemle,
  who acknowledged the fact as calmly as if her post had arrived.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But it turned out that both generals blundered over their estimate of just how
far the enemy really was. It was only when the Friers had effectively bumped
into the Washers like specks of dust hitting a windshield in a sand storm that
the Washers realised that the enemy soldiers weren’t far away; they were just
unbelievably small. The sirens were now blaring on both sides, but the Washers,
apart from shouting ‘In Mumha’s name!’ and ‘Sinmara, watch your back,’ weren’t
entirely sure what to do. The Friers swarmed around their legs; some flying ones
zigzagged around their ears and eyes. The Washers tried to trample on them, to
swat them, to catch them with their hands, but to no avail: by the time the sluggish
giants managed to stir a sinew, the Friers already knew what they were about
to do, and headed for safety.</p>

<p class="pnorm">That said, the Friers were also baffled by the sheer size of the Washers. They
were like paper planes circling so many nuclear submarines: they couldn’t impede
their movements; they couldn’t pierce their covering plates; for the moment it
seemed they could inflict no damage on them at all. It was as if they didn’t
occupy the same universe. The only successful attack was by Mrs Gridhur, who
found the baby Prince, and—convinced, like all other Washers, that it was a
useless spying device—flung it at the what she thought were the leaders of
the miniature army. It’s true that instead of Ricco or Feina she hit 
 Lauda,
  and that it only angered the latter instead of wounding her, but Major General
Gridhur still received a well-deserved cheer from her division.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Get this off me!’ Lauda screamed, as she tried to peel the baby Prince off her
face, which the child was clinging on to for dear life. ‘You’ve <i>touched</i>
it!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">She flung herself at Mrs Gridhur, but bounced off the giant’s rigid surface so
fast that it was hardly possible to follow her course with Washer eyes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Before long, the impossibility for the soldiers to actually engage in a fight threatened
to destroy morale in both camps.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We need to figure out something fast,’ Mrs Gridhur messaged Mrs Beetemle.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘The magnets!’ Nida said to the Councillor. ‘That should take care of these midgets!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Mrs Beetemle agreed and gave the order. The buzz of the hundreds of electromagnets
filled the air.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The strong magnetic field lifted two Frier divisions off the ground, shot the
baby Prince up in the air, and dragged Ricco’s canopy almost half a mile closer
to the front line. The Washers managed to zap a couple of enemy soldiers flying
in the air, but didn’t achieve much more, because the bulk of their catch consisted
of the Friers’ balloons. These, unlike the beryllium ones, were ferromagnetic,
and floated just at the height where the Washers held their magnets, while the
Frier infantry and artillery moved safely on the ground. Just seconds after the
start of the attack, the thousands of silver strings of the balloons snapped
with a crack like that of a whole forest being uprooted, and tons of the tiny
silver spheres stuck firmly onto the magnets.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Some weaker Washers could no longer hold their weapon, and dropped it with the
now permanently magnetised balloons to the ground. Others tried to turn up the
power, but only managed to collect even more balloons, which now looked like
some very expensive type of caviar stuck onto giant knives. The magnets were
struggling and began to heat up, and, finally, Mrs Beetemle ordered everyone
to abandon them altogether before they discharged her soldiers. They’d stripped
the Friers of one of their weapons, but had accomplished precious little.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco
  decided that it was time to launch a real attack and deploy their oil jets to
retaliate. The sirens sounded again, and the Friers pressed forward, some on
wings but most on foot, directing the high-pressure jets at the Washers. It took
a couple of minutes for the Washers to understand what was going on. At first,
all they noticed was that it suddenly became easier to move their ankles and
knees due to the unexpected extra lubrication, and that slowly, a black fog rose
in the wake of the Frier troops, formed by the cyan dust and the oil spray. But
it wasn’t until the fog had shrouded the whole battlefield and blocked out the
sun sufficiently that they could inspect the new weapon they were facing in the
darkness comfortable for their eyes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Dul
  attempted to move his company on the left to outflank the enemy, but they were
hardly able to advance against the oncoming waves of the spray. All other captains
had already given orders to brace to weather the oily storm, and Dul conceded
that there was nothing else his soldiers could do. But as he started to manoeuvre
himself around his next in command, he noticed a speckle of light dancing on
top the oily clouds. He extended his arm just in time to catch it—it was the
Prince, which he unceremoniously flung back at Ricco.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Ricco lost control when the baby, extending its tiny arms and babbling ‘Daddy,
daddy,’ landed on the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It’s contaminated!’ he screamed. ‘Feina! Feina!’ he looked around helplessly.
Feina dutifully removed the chirping robot with two fingers, dropped it away
from herself, and wiped the King’s mouth with a handkerchief. But Ricco, turning
his eyes to the sky in terror, was far from calming down.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Now it’s getting dark!’ he trembled.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Yes,’ Feina replied, ‘it’s the oil.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Cease! Cease!’ Ricco howled at his 
 generals.
  ‘We need the light! Can’t you see what you’re doing?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Gradually, the momentum of their attack slowed down, and then finally stopped.
But while the Friers stopped the oil jets and looked inquiringly at their King,
the Washers wasted no time in taking advantage of the situation, and prepared
to shoot their water cannons. The Friers, hardly larger than a drop of water,
had no chance of withstanding their force.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The liquid gushed forward from the muzzles, and flooded the battlefield in seconds.
The dust on the ground painted the whirling sea cyan; the red of Ricco’s canopy,
and all of the Frier army for that matter, disappeared under the currents.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The Washers cheered. Their high spirits were only dampened when Braxon discovered
that he could no longer move. He was stuck in the mud up to his knees.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Cease water!’ Mrs Beetemle ordered in terror. They’d never tried the cannons
on dust before, but she should’ve foreseen this to happen.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Don’t move!’ Nida shouted. ‘Whatever you do, don’t move!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Everybody froze. The cannons were stopped. The seemingly bottomless cyan desert
quickly drank up the water. Small puddles formed where the Frier army used to
be, and on one of them, a tiny speck of metal balanced on the water, laughing.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Erf! Erf!’ it giggled, and glided to the opposite end of the puddle on a little
wave. He was so small that his weight only dented the surface of the water.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hey, I can do it, too!’ shouted another voice, and a winged Frier agent, who’d
just climbed out of the drying mud leaving a tiny hole behind, hopped on the
water. The surface tension could’ve supported more than five times his weight.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The ground was now dry enough for Cynd to risk a cautious step towards Braxon.
Bit by bit, he reached him, and unscrewed his own breastplate.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What the fuck are you doing?’ Braxon said. His waist was now only inches above
the surface.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd slowly laid the plate on the ground, and stepped on it with his right foot.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Here,’ he offered his arm to Braxon. ‘As soon as you’re out a bit, grab the
plate. It’ll support you.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">By the time Braxon was free from the grip of the quicksand, the whole Frier army
had found its way out of the mud as well, and were busy organising their ranks
on top of the puddles.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Oh for Mumha’s sake,’ Mrs Beetemle erupted once Braxon was safe and she was
able to focus again. ‘They can walk on water.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘It does seem so, yes,’ Nida acknowledged, hardly being able to hide her exasperation.
‘I wish the same was true of our cannons.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">They both looked there. The cannons were almost completely submerged in the blue–green
slush they’d created.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">‘Look at the gutless jerks! Get out the flames! We’ll lick’em, that’s what we’ll
do!’ 
 Feina
  encouraged the microscopic Frier army as they finished forming their ranks.
The oil streams cleared the ignition systems of the last molecule of water, and
the hiss and heat of their flames filled the trembling air. Once more Ricco sounded
the sirens; once more thousands of throats echoed Exe’s name. But now their strategy
was different. They attacked in swarms, with whole squads directing their streams
of flames at one joint or one bolt. Most of them were already busy on the heels
and toenails of the first line of the Washer infantry when 
 Lauda,
  flying close to the ground, caught sight of the baby Prince splashing about
in the middle of the battlefield. She grabbed him, and hurled him at Mrs Gridhur
before setting on the Major General herself.</p>

<p class="pnorm">No matter how fast the Washers tried to run away from the flames, or whisk the
insistent Friers away from their legs and waists, and no matter how thick their
armours were, the tiny flames quickly cut through the screws, bolts and solder.
Layer by layer, the giants lost their protective plates. Cynd’s back plate landed
with a loud thud on the ground; Mrs Gridhur stood almost naked, deprived of the
decorative cover that was the privilege of her rank. But still, at that rate,
it would’ve taken years before the Friers could get anywhere near the circuits
of the Washers. Their enemy started to look smaller, but not any more vulnerable.
And, the less they weighed, the easier they moved to boot. Plate by plate, they
sped up, and soon they were able to move and fan fast enough to make it pretty
difficult for the Friers to get near them at all.</p>

<p class="pnorm">But Mrs Beetemle was unwilling to wait until her soldiers were reduced to the
size of the Friers. She ordered bombing the enemy with rice.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Are you sure it’s going to work?’ Nida asked.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Sheer mass has never failed to make an impact. Look!’ Mrs Beetemle pointed to
the left, where one projectile had just landed with a thunderous noise. There
couldn’t have been anything that survived the torrent of grains hitting the ground.
Soon even the Washers were wading up to the knees in the rice. The enemy was
down there, somewhere, hopefully gone and forgotten for ever.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was the soldiers in Dul’s company that started to murmur first, retreating
step by step to get away from the rice.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I can’t see a thing, sir,’ one of them said. ‘This damned thing’s too bright.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hey, how are we supposed to find the little fuckers now? I’m practically blind,’
complained another.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘I hope the state will pay for a new pair of eyes ’cause I swear mine’s fucked.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘A couple of eyes and Sinmara is defeated,’ murmured General Beetemle. ‘I think
we did OK.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Unbeknown to the Washers, the Friers were alive and quite well under the rice.
They were no worse off in the space between the grains than the Washers would’ve
been if giant cornflakes had dropped on them from the sky. Adda, with her size,
was helping out by burrowing a network of tunnels, and freeing legs and wings
trapped under and between the grains.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘OK,’ Feina said to Ricco, with her mouth compressing into a thin line of unmistakable
annoyance. ‘We’re still here, and they’re still there. Now what are you going
to do?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘No problem. We’ve made some headway. And I think it’s time for our secret weapon.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Admittedly, none of the belligerents had had much luck with their newly developed
weapons so far, and this one was no exception. The heat ray was effective against
robots indeed, but the uncontrollable microwaves heated up everything around
the oscillators. And when, at one point, the trillions of oily rice grains began
to yield, and puffed up with a pop that surprised the Washers, and deafened the
Friers, pandemonium broke loose. As a last, desperate attempt, General Beetemle
herself launched the balls of territorial rice, which, as expected, slumped into
the cyan quagmire of oily puffed rice and disappeared without a trace. And then,
there were no more weapons that could’ve promised quick and easy victory. All
of the robots, on foot, on wings and on wheels joined the <i>mêlée,</i>
which turned out to be as fruitless as the whole battle.</p>

<p class="pnorm">The Friers, whenever they managed to scramble to the surface of the mud, strove
to cling onto and kick, bite, burn or hack into the Washers, but, apart from
detaching a couple of more plates from their armours, could hardly achieve anything.
The Washers, exhausted from snatching at the tiny agents that buzzed around them
like messengers around street lamps, resorted to sifting through the slush to
capture or pinch to death at least a couple of Friers. But all the effort was
to no avail: the oily sludge separated the mortal enemies better than a space
the size of the Great Void.</p>

<p class="pnorm">All the will to fight on might’ve left the Washers if Braxon hadn’t caught a
glimpse of Ricco’s head as it surfaced between two grains of rice. They didn’t
need the catch all the Friers! They only needed to kill one—the King. And so
Braxon, Cynd and Dul waded through the mud in the direction where Braxon had
seen the monarch. They passed Mrs Gridhur, who had a strange egg-shaped thing
stuck to her shoulder.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Hey!’ Cynd shouted at her. ‘Gridhur, you’ve got one on your back!’</p>

<p class="pnorm">But Mrs Gridhur was busy boring her five-metre arms into the slush, pulling out
whatever she could find, and throwing the glaring cyan sludge with Friers too
small to bother with aside. At that moment, the egg-shaped thing grabbed her
collar, and pulled itself up to her neck. It was larger than the Friers, but
it was obviously up to no good.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘Gridhur! Your neck!’ Cynd shouted again, but Mrs Gridhur still couldn’t hear
him.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd motioned Dul and Braxon to keep going, and started to move towards Gridhur.
He kept shooing away the flying agents with his hands to protect himself from
their flamethrowers, and tried to step in the middle of puddles, where he suspected
there weren’t too many enemy soldiers underground. His soles and ankles were
already scorched and perforated by thousands of tiny holes.</p>

<p class="pnorm">By the time he got to Mrs Gridhur, the egg-shaped thing was already balancing
itself on her ear. As he leaned closer, he noticed that it was a robot, trying
to pull something out of Gridhur’s ear canal with all its might.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘What the…?’ Mrs Gridhur exclaimed in surprise when she noticed Cynd stooping
over her. She recognised him too late to interrupt the instinct that flung her
arms up to defend herself; she lost her balance, and tumbled backwards into the
foamy rice. The sudden fall sent the small robot flying in the air. It landed
neatly in front of Cynd’s feet.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was Adda, and she was clasping the baby Prince in her arms.</p>

<p class="pbigskip">She looked up at 
 Cynd, who towered over the small sphere that she’d become. Her eyes were warm,
but still glittered with youthful mischief and excitement as she regarded the
familiar face that now hovered above her like a square moon.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’ve changed,’ she said. Her voice had aged; it was thinner than what Cynd
remembered.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘You’ve changed, too,’ he replied.</p>

<p class="pnorm">He moved his eyes to the familiar form of the child. ‘Don’t you need to give
him back to Ricco?’</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘He doesn’t want him.’ She looked around uncertainly, and then back at Cynd.
The noise of the raging battle could no longer reach them. ‘I don’t think anyone
wants him.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">The baby extended his arms toward Cynd.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘He looks just like the child I imagined we’d build,’ Cynd said.</p>

<p class="pnorm">Adda smiled at the tiny robot, and stroked his infinitesimal cheeks. ‘He does,
doesn’t he? All that’s left then is to build a house.’ She looked up again, and
smiled. ‘You said you’d build the best one in the world.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">Cynd felt some hotness building up in his neck. ‘I can try,’ he said shyly. ‘And
you said it should be somewhere far away. Maybe in another galaxy.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">There was a pause.</p>

<p class="pnorm">‘We should get going, then,’ Adda said finally. ‘It’s going to be a long journey.’</p>

<p class="pnorm">They got up, and, without looking back, walked away from the battleground, the
agents, the councillors, the generals, and all the forces that had moulded them
into what they’d become. Although the battle appeared to have frozen into utter
hopelessness, there was something fermenting beneath. The territorial rice, having
found ample nutrition in the flooded soil, burst into life, and, in seconds,
the delicate seedlings turned the battlefield into a verdant burial ground for
the War of Heights.</p>

<p class="pnorm">It was a strange burial ground, to be sure: no one was dead, and the War lived
on as well. But if at that moment, there had been an astronomer on the other
side of the Great Void looking at the planet through a powerful telescope, all
she would’ve seen were a gentle meadow under an orange sky; a giant robot ambling
toward the reddening horizon; and a smaller, round machine sitting on the shoulder
of the giant, who, in turn, was balancing an even tinier robot on its arm.</p>

<p class="pnorm">For two of the inhabitants of that planet, it was their first sunset together.
And it was light and darkness—and it was beautiful.</p>
