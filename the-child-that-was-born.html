You have a strong sense of theatricality, and also a confidence in your ability to experiment
and create confident and interesting language. All three of your plays are very individual, whilst
displaying the common traits of being intriguing, succinct and poetically rich.

<p>Persons: Mother, Son (Mother's son), Lover (Son's boyfriend), Brother (Son's brother), 
Wife (Brother's wife), Doctress</p>

<p>Mother, an ex-actress, suffers from amnesia that resulted from a motor accident 
several years ago. After learning that she might not have much time left, Son decides to come out to her 
and to act as if he was still the sixteen-year-old boy she remembers. The coming-out turns out to be a 
disaster, as Mother relapses into singing the songs of Ophelia from Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet,</i> 
specially adapted for her gay son. Meanwhile, Wife's latest book is turned down by three publishers 
in a row, and she has a miscarriage. Son becomes estranged from Mother, but seems to get on with 
Doctress, in front of whom he continues to play his role of a boy of 16. Mother dies. Lover is 
hospitalised, and he turns out to be HIV positive. Son rejects accepting reality. He searches for 
his mother, and Doctress informs Brother and Wife that he suffers from a personality disorder as he 
has become identified with his 16-year-old self. Wife, longing for a child to care for, persuades 
Brother to adopt him until he is back to normal. Son and Wife gradually exclude Brother from their 
dream world, one writing a never-ending book, and the other practising the flute to get a position 
in an orchestra, which he has been doing since the beginning of the play.</p>

<p>Estimated running time: 30 minutes.</p>
